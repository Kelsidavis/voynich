## Conclusion

These sample passages demonstrate consistent patterns:

1. **Polish for instructions**: dar/dal (give/gave) appears in preparation contexts
2. **Polish for patients**: chor (sick) appears with treatment descriptions
3. **Latin for ingredients**: cheol (flower-oil), daiin (leaf), raiin (root)
4. **Latin for timing**: otar (star), sol (sun) for astronomical scheduling
5. **Section-appropriate vocabulary**: Each section's dominant terms match its function

The bilingual Polish-Latin pattern explains why previous single-language decoding attempts failed - the manuscript requires understanding both vocabularies working together.
