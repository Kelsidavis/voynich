# Investigation: What do 'dar' and 'dal' actually mean?

## Previous Claim (v7.5 decoder)

| Word | Claimed Meaning | Language |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| dar | dać (to give) | Polish infinitive |
| dal | dał (he gave) | Polish past tense |

This was presented as key evidence for Polish authorship and the "medical instruction" interpretation.

## Evidence Against the Polish Verb Hypothesis

### 1. Distributional Failure

If 'dar'/'dal' meant "give"/"gave", they should concentrate in **recipe/instruction sections**.

**Actual distribution (per 1000 words):**

| Word | Herbal | Astro | Bio | Rosettes | Recipe |
|------|--------|-------|-----|----------|--------|
| dar | 8.9 | 11.7 | 9.4 | 14.9 | **4.7** |
| dal | 4.2 | 10.4 | 9.7 | 6.6 | **4.0** |

**Result:** dar/dal are LOWEST in recipe section. They peak in astronomical and rosettes sections.

This **falsifies** the "instruction verb" hypothesis.

### 2. Morphological Evidence

179 stems in the corpus appear with BOTH -ar AND -al endings:

| Stem | -ar form | -al form | Ratio |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| d | dar (297) | dal (243) | 1.22 |
| qok | qokar (149) | qokal (188) | 0.79 |
| ot | otar (139) | otal (137) | 1.01 |
| ok | okar (124) | okal (133) | 0.93 |
| ch | char (71) | chal (46) | 1.54 |

**Conclusion:** -ar and -al are **productive suffixes**, not part of the root.

Therefore:
- dar = d + ar (root + suffix)
- dal = d + al (root + suffix)

They are **the same root with different suffixes**, NOT different verb tenses.

### 3. Missing Polish Forms

If Polish, we should see complete paradigms:

| Expected Form | Polish | Corpus Count |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| daj | imperative "give!" | **0** |
| daję | 1st person "I give" | **0** |
| dasz | 2nd person "you give" | **0** |
| damy | 1st plural "we give" | **0** |

The imperative 'daj' was supposedly a key instruction verb - but it doesn't exist in the corpus.

### 4. The 'd' Root Pattern

All forms of 'd' + suffix:

| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| daiin | 805 | d + aiin (case marker 1) |
| dar | 297 | d + ar (suffix -ar) |
| dal | 243 | d + al (suffix -al) |
| dy | 226 | d + y (adjectival) |
| dain | 189 | d + ain (case marker 2) |
| dol | 111 | d + ol (substantival) |
| dair | 100 | d + air (variant) |
| dam | 89 | d + am (suffix -am) |
| dor | 70 | d + or (agentive) |

**Total 'd' root tokens: 2,130**

This is the pattern of a **highly productive noun root**, not a verb.

---

## What 'd' Likely Is

### Evidence for 'd' = botanical term (leaf/plant)

1. **'daiin' is the #1 most common word** (805 occurrences)
2. **45% of 'daiin' occurs in herbal section** (vs 11% expected by chance)
3. **Herbal sections describe plants** - nouns expected, not verbs
4. **The morphological pattern** (d + case markers) fits noun declension

### Tentative Analysis

| Form | Structure | Possible Meaning |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| daiin | d + aiin | leaf (nominative) |
| dain | d + ain | leaf (accusative) |
| dar | d + ar | leaf + suffix (genitive? adjective?) |
| dal | d + al | leaf + suffix (dative? locative?) |
| dy | d + y | leafy / of leaves |
| dol | d + ol | leaf-substance? |

## Conclusion

### Hypothesis Status

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| dar = Polish "dać" (give) | **REJECTED** | Wrong distribution, morphology |
| dal = Polish "dał" (gave) | **REJECTED** | Same root as dar + different suffix |
| dar/dal are verbs | **REJECTED** | Noun-like distribution pattern |
| d = noun root | **PLAUSIBLE** | Herbal clustering, case morphology |
| d = "leaf" specifically | **SPECULATIVE** | Requires external validation |

### What We Know

1. 'dar' and 'dal' are forms of the **same root 'd'**
2. '-ar' and '-al' are **grammatical suffixes** (179 stems use both)
3. The root 'd' behaves like a **noun**, not a verb
4. The root 'd' clusters in **botanical sections**
5. The **exact meaning** cannot be determined without external validation

### What This Means for the Decoder

The v7.5 decoder's core claim - that 'dar'/'dal' prove Polish medical instructions - is **not supported by the corpus data**.

The manuscript may still contain Polish elements, but this particular evidence has collapsed under scrutiny.
