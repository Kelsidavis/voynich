# Investigation: Altaic Language Family Connection to Voynich

## Background: The Altaic Hypothesis

The Altaic language family (controversial) traditionally groups:
1. **Turkic** - Turkish, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kazakh, Old Turkic
2. **Mongolic** - Mongolian, Buryat, Kalmyk
3. **Tungusic** - Manchu, Evenki
4. **Korean** (controversial inclusion)
5. **Japanese** (controversial inclusion)

These languages share:
- Agglutinative morphology (suffix-heavy)
- Subject-Object-Verb word order
- Vowel harmony (in most)
- Similar basic vocabulary

## Test Results by Language

### 1. Modern Turkish (Reference - Previous Test)

**17+ vocabulary matches** (best result of any language):

| Voynich | Count | Turkish | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| ol | 525 | ol | be/become |
| al | 253 | al | take |
| dal | 243 | dal | branch |
| dar | 297 | dar | narrow |
| dol | 111 | dol | fill |
| sol | 67 | sol | left |
| sal | 54 | sal | raft |
| kol | 37 | kol | arm |
| kor | 25 | kor | ember |
| kar | 52 | kar | snow |
| sar | 83 | sar | wrap |
| ot | 10 | ot | grass |
| ok | 5 | ok | arrow |
| yol | 2 | yol | road |

### 2. Mongolian

| Voynich | Count | Mongolian | Meaning |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| ol | 525 | ol- | to find, obtain |
| al | 253 | al- | to take, kill |
| dal | 243 | dal | mane (of horse) |
| sar | 83 | sar/sara | moon, month |
| tal | 19 | tal | steppe, plain |
| kol | 37 | khöl | leg, foot |
| od | 5 | od | star |
| ot | 10 | ot | fire |

**8 vocabulary matches** - significant overlap with Turkish!

---

### 3. Old Turkic / Chagatai

Old Turkic preserved the "q" sound that modern Turkish changed to "k".

| Voynich | Count | Old Turkic | Meaning |
|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| qol | 148 | qol | arm, hand |
| qor | 23 | qor- | verb root |
| sal | 54 | sal | raft |
| yar | 2 | yar | cliff, beloved |
| yal | 1 | yal | mane |
| dag | 1 | tağ/dağ | mountain |
| tal | 19 | tal | steppe |

**7 vocabulary matches** - notably the "qo-" forms!

### Critical Observation: qo- prefix

Voynich has extensive qo- forms:
- qokaiin (262), qokain (277), qokedy (265), qol (148), etc.

In Old Turkic, "q" was a distinct phoneme (uvular stop) different from "k".
This could explain Voynich's qo-/ko- distinction!

---

### 4. Manchu (Tungusic)

| Voynich | Count | Manchu | Meaning |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| dolo | 1 | dolo | inside |

**Only 1 match** - not significant.

---

### 5. Korean

| Voynich | Count | Korean | Meaning |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| chol | 381 | cheol | iron, season |
| cheol | 167 | cheol | iron, season |
| dal | 243 | dal | moon |
| sal | 54 | sal | flesh, age |
| tal | 19 | tal | mask |
| kol | 37 | kol | valley |
| dol | 111 | dol | stone |
| sol | 67 | sol | pine tree |
| san | 3 | san | mountain |
| pal | 2 | pal | foot |

**10 vocabulary matches** - but heavily overlapping with Turkish!

## Cross-Language Comparison

### Words Shared Across Multiple Altaic Languages

| Voynich | Turkish | Mongolian | Korean | Old Turkic |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|------------|
| ol (525) | ol (be) | ol (find) | - | ol |
| al (253) | al (take) | al (take) | - | al |
| dal (243) | dal (branch) | dal (mane) | dal (moon) | - |
| kol (37) | kol (arm) | khöl (leg) | kol (valley) | qol |
| sal (54) | sal (raft) | - | sal (flesh) | sal |
| tal (19) | - | tal (steppe) | tal (mask) | tal |
| sar (83) | sar (wrap) | sar (moon) | - | - |

**These are exactly the words used as evidence for the Altaic hypothesis itself!**

## Analysis: Why Altaic Languages Show Matches

### Possibility 1: Altaic Substrate

The Voynich author had contact with Altaic-speaking peoples:
- 15th century trade routes connected Europe to Central Asia
- Mongol Empire had reached Eastern Europe (1240s)
- Turkic peoples (Cumans, Kipchaks) lived in Eastern Europe
- Ottoman Turks were a major power by 1400s

### Possibility 2: Common Simple Syllables

Many matches are simple CV or CVC patterns:
- ol, al, dal, kol, sal, tal, sar, kar, dar

These patterns exist in MANY unrelated languages.

### Possibility 3: Coincidence + Confirmation Bias

We're finding patterns because we're looking for them.

## The Critical Morphology Test

### Do Voynich words follow Altaic grammar?

**Turkish suffixes:**
- -lar/-ler (plural) → NOT FOUND in Voynich
- -da/-de (locative) → NOT FOUND
- -dan/-den (ablative) → NOT FOUND

**Mongolian suffixes:**
- -ууд/-үүд (plural) → NOT FOUND
- -д/-т (dative) → NOT FOUND
- -аас/-ээс (ablative) → NOT FOUND

**Korean particles:**
- -은/-는 (topic) → NOT FOUND
- -이/-가 (subject) → NOT FOUND
- -을/-를 (object) → NOT FOUND

**What Voynich DOES have:**
- -aiin, -ain, -dy, -edy, -ol, -or, -ar (unique to Voynich)

### Result: Grammar is NOT Altaic

The vocabulary shows matches, but the grammatical system is uniquely Voynich.

## The qo- Mystery

One intriguing finding: Voynich's extensive qo- prefix system.

| Voynich qo- forms | Count |
|-------------------|-------|
| qokaiin | 262 |
| qokain | 277 |
| qokedy | 265 |
| qokeey | 308 |
| qokeedy | 301 |
| qol | 148 |
| qokar | 149 |
| qokal | 188 |

In Old Turkic, "q" was a distinct sound:
- qol (arm) vs kök (sky)
- Modern Turkish merged these to "k"

**Hypothesis**: Could qo- represent an Old Turkic q- element?

However, we already established qo- is a DETERMINER (like "the") based on:
- 412 word pairs where qo-X and X both exist
- qo- form is 2-8x more frequent

This doesn't match Turkic grammar, where articles don't exist.

## Summary Table

| Language | Vocab Matches | Grammar Match | Function Words |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Turkish** | **17+** | NO | NO |
| Mongolian | 8 | NO | NO |
| Old Turkic | 7 | NO | NO |
| Korean | 10 | NO | NO |
| Manchu | 1 | NO | NO |

## Conclusion

### The Altaic Connection

| Finding | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Vocabulary overlap | **SIGNIFICANT** (17+ Turkish, 8 Mongolian, 10 Korean) |
| Grammatical structure | **NO MATCH** (Voynich suffixes unique) |
| Morphology type | **MATCHES** (both agglutinative) |
| Function words | **NO MATCH** (none found) |
| Vowel harmony | **NO MATCH** (Voynich violates it) |

### Interpretation

**The Voynich manuscript shows LEXICAL similarity to Altaic languages but NOT grammatical similarity.**

Possible explanations:

1. **Trade Language / Pidgin**
   - Basic Altaic vocabulary
   - Simplified/unique grammar
   - Used for commerce along Silk Road?

2. **Constructed Language with Altaic Influence**
   - Creator knew Turkic/Mongolian vocabulary
   - Invented own grammatical system
   - 15th century Central European contact with East

3. **Coincidental CV Pattern Overlap**
   - Simple syllables (ol, al, dal, sal, kol) exist in many languages
   - May not indicate actual relationship

4. **Unknown Language with Areal Features**
   - A language in contact with Altaic speakers
   - Borrowed vocabulary but kept own grammar
   - Caucasian? Central Asian minority language?

### Final Assessment

**Altaic hypothesis: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

- MORE vocabulary matches than any Indo-European language
- But grammar is NOT Altaic
- Turkish remains the single best vocabulary match
- Could indicate contact/influence rather than identity

## Recommendation for Further Research

1. **Test Caucasian languages** (Georgian, Armenian, Chechen)
2. **Test Uralic languages** (Hungarian, Finnish) - also agglutinative
3. **Test extinct trade languages** (Cuman, Khazar, Bulgar)
4. **Historical analysis** of 15th century Central European contact with Turkic peoples
