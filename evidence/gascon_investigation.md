# Investigation: Gascon Connection to Voynich

## Background

Gascon is relevant because:

1. **Occitan dialect** spoken in southwestern France (Gascony)
2. **Adjacent to Basque Country** - potential contact language
3. **Basque substrate influence** - unique among Romance languages
4. **15th century presence** - active during manuscript's era
5. **Distinctive features** - Latin f- → h- (unique phonological change)

If Voynich shows Basque connections, Gascon might be a bridge language.

## Test 2: Gascon-Specific Features

### The f- → h- Change

Gascon uniquely changed Latin f- to h-:
- Latin *filius* → Gascon *hilh* (son)
- Latin *facere* → Gascon *har* (to do)
- Latin *folia* → Gascon *hòlha* (leaf)
- Latin *farina* → Gascon *harina* (flour)

| Gascon h- word | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| har | to do | **0** |
| hilh | son | **0** |
| hòlha | leaf | **0** |
| hòrt | strong | **0** |
| hum | smoke | **0** |

**Result: NO Gascon h- words found - this is diagnostic.**

If Voynich were Gascon, we would expect h- words from Latin f-.

## Test 3: Gascon Articles

|---------|------|---------------|

| las | the (f.pl.) | 1 (weak) |

The definite articles appear rarely and not in article position.

## Analysis

### Why Gascon Shows Some Matches

1. **Simple syllables**: dar, por, lor, sor are common CV+C patterns
2. **Pan-Romance vocabulary**: These words exist in multiple Romance languages
3. **No unique evidence**: Nothing distinctively Gascon

### Why Gascon is NOT the Source

1. **Missing h- words**: The f- → h- change is Gascon's signature feature - absent
2. **No function words**: e, que, de all missing
3. **Wrong morphology**: Voynich is agglutinative, Gascon is not
4. **Basque stronger**: Adjacent Basque shows 17 matches vs Gascon's 10

### Gascon-Basque Contact Theory

Could Voynich be a Basque-Gascon contact language?

Evidence FOR:
- Both regions geographically connected
- 15th century Gascony bordered Basque Country
- Some vocabulary overlap

Evidence AGAINST:
- Gascon features (h- words, Romance morphology) absent
- Basque features (unique vocabulary) present
- Grammar is neither Basque nor Romance

---

## Conclusion

### Gascon Hypothesis: REJECTED

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Vocabulary | 10 matches (moderate) |
| Unique matches | **0** (none specific to Gascon) |
| h- from f- | **ABSENT** (diagnostic failure) |
| Function words | **0** |
| Morphology | NOT Romance |

### Assessment

Gascon shows 10 vocabulary matches, but:
- All matches are pan-Romance (not Gascon-specific)
- The diagnostic h- feature is completely absent
- Morphology doesn't match
- Adjacent Basque is a much stronger candidate

### Final Ranking

| Rank | Language | Matches | Unique | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Turkish** | 17+ | ~5 | Best agglutinative match |
| 1 | **Basque** | 17 | **6** | Best unique matches |
| 3 | Hungarian | 12 | ~3 | Central European |
| 4 | Korean | 10 | ~2 | Altaic |
| 5 | Gascon | 10 | 0 | Pan-Romance only |
| 6 | Mongolian | 8 | ~1 | Central Asian |

The Basque-Turkish-Hungarian pattern remains strongest.
