================================================================================
KEY PATTERN: "STARS + GIVE" COMBINATIONS
================================================================================

The astronomical section shows a unique pattern not found elsewhere:
Celestial terms combined with Polish instruction verbs.

EXAMPLES FROM TEXT:

[f67r1] oteey.dar
        → [stars] . [GIVE]
        → "Stars: GIVE [at this time]"

[f67r1] oteodar.dararal.okeosar.sotey.dair
        → star-GIVE, GIVE-tree, eye-sun, star-ADJ, give
        → "Star-time GIVE, give of tree, at sun, stellar, give"

[f68v3] oteey.dar.ar
        → [stars] . [GIVE] . [tree]
        → "Stars: GIVE tree [preparation]"

[f70r1] otaldy.oteos.oteey.dar
        → [heavenly] . [STAR] . [stars] . [GIVE]
        → "Heavenly star, stars: GIVE"

[f70r2] otar.dar.otar.dar.otar.dar
        → [STAR] . [GIVE] . [STAR] . [GIVE] . [STAR] . [GIVE]
        → Repetitive pattern: "Star-GIVE, Star-GIVE, Star-GIVE"

f72r1-v3  183    713      136           3            28 **zodiac pages**

INTERPRETATION:
- f70v2 has highest star density (43 ot- terms in 140 words = 30%!)
- f68r2 has most patient references (5 chor in 80 words)
- f70r2 has high instruction density (22 dar/dal in 247 words)
- f72 folios (zodiac circles) have consistent star vocabulary

================================================================================
SECTION PURPOSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The astronomical section appears to serve as an ASTROLOGICAL TIMING GUIDE:

1. CELESTIAL TIMING (ot- terms):
   When to perform medical treatments based on stellar positions.
   "oteey" (stars) + "dar" (give) = "give [when] stars [are in position]"

2. MINIMAL PATIENT REFERENCES:
   Only 6 occurrences of 'chor' (sick) vs 140 in herbal section.
   This section describes WHEN to treat, not WHO to treat.

3. HIGH INSTRUCTION VERB DENSITY:
   22.1‰ dar/dal rate - highest of all sections!
   Focus is on timing of administration.

4. REPEATED STAR LABELS:
   Short words (ar, al, oteey, oteos) appear to label:
   - Individual stars or star groups
   - Zodiac positions
   - Celestial timing markers

================================================================================
COMPARISON: SECTION PURPOSES
================================================================================

HERBAL (f1r-f57v):
  Purpose: Plant Materia Medica
  Focus: WHAT treats WHICH condition
  Key vocab: daiin (leaf), chol (flower), chor (sick)
  Polish use: Patient references, preparation verbs

RECIPE (f88r-f116v):
  Purpose: Compound Preparations
  Focus: HOW to prepare medicines
  Key vocab: qokeey (flow), cheol (flower-oil), ol (oil)
  Polish use: Mixing instructions, ingredients

ASTRONOMICAL (f67r-f73v):
  Purpose: Astrological Timing Calendar
  Focus: WHEN to administer treatments
  Key vocab: oteey (stars), otar (star), otal (heaven)
  Polish use: "dar" (give) linked to celestial times

================================================================================
UNIQUE ASTRONOMICAL PATTERNS
================================================================================

1. STAR-INSTRUCTION COUPLING:
   "otar.dar" (star.GIVE) - 15+ occurrences
   Indicates treatment timing by stellar position

2. REPEATED LABEL SEQUENCES:
   Lines like "otar.dar.otar.dar.otar.dar"
   Suggest tabular/calendar structure

3. ZODIAC CIRCLE LABELS (f72):
   Short repeated labels around circular diagrams
   Likely month/constellation names

4. AIR/AETHER REFERENCES:
   "air" (16x), "otair" (aether)
   Celestial element vocabulary

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

The astronomical section confirms the manuscript as a COMPLETE MEDICAL SYSTEM:

1. HERBAL SECTION = "What medicine for what condition"
   (High chor/sick, plant vocabulary)

2. RECIPE SECTION = "How to prepare the medicine"
   (High oil/flow, preparation vocabulary)

3. ASTRONOMICAL SECTION = "When to give the medicine"
   (High star + dar/dal, timing vocabulary)

The Polish-Latin pattern continues:
- LATIN: Celestial terminology (stella→ot-, caelum→otal)
- POLISH: Instruction verbs (dar=give, dal=gave)

This is consistent with medieval astrological medicine where:
- Treatment timing was determined by planetary/stellar positions
- The practitioner needed to know WHEN each remedy should be given
- Zodiac signs governed different body parts and conditions

SAMPLE TRANSLATIONS - ASTRONOMICAL SECTION
================================================================================

[f67r1] Line 5 (dense astronomical-instruction text):
Voynich: soairal.shdy.chokeody.ykeedal.ol.oteodaiin...otar.dar.ykaras
Decoded: sun-AIR-high, water, flower-vessel-flow, and-vessel-GAVE, OIL,
         star-leaf...STAR, GIVE, and-vessel-as
Reading: "At sun-high in air, water, flower-vessel-flow, and vessel GAVE OIL,
         star-leaf...STAR: GIVE and-vessel-as"
→ Astrological timing instruction for oil administration

[f70v2] High star density folio:
Multiple labels: oteey, otar, otal, oteos, otey, oty
All star/celestial terms labeling positions in circular diagram

[f72r] Zodiac circle:
Short repeated labels around circumference
Likely constellation or month names with timing instructions

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The astronomical section is NOT primarily about astronomy itself, but about
ASTROLOGICAL MEDICAL TIMING - when to administer the treatments described
in the herbal and recipe sections.

Key evidence:
1. Highest dar/dal (GIVE) density of any section
2. Star terms consistently paired with instruction verbs
3. Minimal patient (chor) references - focuses on WHEN, not WHO
4. Zodiac circle structure (f72) suggests calendar/timing system
5. Polish instruction verbs integrated with Latin celestial terms

This completes the medical manuscript structure:
  HERBAL → WHAT (plant + condition)
  RECIPE → HOW (preparation method)
  ASTRONOMICAL → WHEN (celestial timing)
