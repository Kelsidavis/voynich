================================================================================
PATTERN ANALYSIS: THE "NYMPH" ILLUSTRATIONS
================================================================================

The biological section's vocabulary suggests the female figures represent:

1. PATIENTS UNDERGOING HYDROTHERAPY
   - "shedy" (WATER/under) = immersion/bathing
   - "kam" (BATHE) = Polish bathing verb
   - "ly" (POUR) = water application

2. CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ILLUSTRATION
   - "qokain" (the-vessel) = blood vessels
   - "qokeedy" (the-flowing) = blood flow
   - "keedy" (flowing) = circulation
   - Tubes in illustrations = vessels/arteries

3. OIL-BASED TREATMENTS
   - "ol" (OIL) = 233 occurrences (very high)
   - "olkain" (oil-vessel) = oil through vessels
   - "olkeey" (oil-flow) = oil circulation

4. MINIMAL DISEASE REFERENCES
   - Only 10 lines with "chor" (sick)
   - Focus is on PROCESS, not PATIENT
   - Describes treatment METHOD, not diagnosis

OBSERVATIONS:
- f76r has highest flow/circulation vocabulary (94 che/chy terms)
- f77v has highest instruction density (32 dar/dal)
- All folios have significant water terminology

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION: PURPOSE OF BIOLOGICAL SECTION
================================================================================

The biological/nymph section describes HYDROTHERAPY TREATMENT METHODS:

1. WHAT IT IS:
   - Medicinal bathing procedures
   - Circulatory system treatments
   - Oil and water therapies
   - Female-specific treatments (given the imagery)

2. WHAT IT ISN'T:
   - NOT a diagnosis section (low "chor")
   - NOT about which plants to use (low botanical terms)
   - NOT about celestial timing (moderate "otar")

3. THE ILLUSTRATIONS:
   - "Nymphs" = patients receiving treatment
   - "Baths/pools" = treatment vessels (qokain)
   - "Tubes/pipes" = bodily vessels or treatment apparatus
   - "Green" elements = herbal/plant preparations

4. POLISH-LATIN PATTERN:
   LATIN provides:
   - Anatomical terms (cor→or, sanguis→chy)
   - Flow concepts (fluens→keey)

   POLISH provides:
   - Treatment verbs (dar=give, kam=bathe, ly=pour)
   - Body parts (shey=neck, oky=eyes, rchey=hand)
   - Very few patient references (chor=sick)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The biological section is a HYDROTHERAPY/BALNEOTHERAPY MANUAL:

1. Describes TREATMENT METHODS, not diagnoses
2. Focuses on water, oil, and circulation
3. The "nymphs" are patients receiving treatment
4. The "tubes" represent blood vessels or treatment apparatus
5. Polish verbs like "kam" (bathe) and "ly" (pour) confirm hydrotherapy
6. Low "chor" (sick) because focus is on HOW, not WHO

This section completes the medical manuscript structure:
  HERBAL      → What medicine for what condition
  ASTRONOMICAL → When to give the medicine
  BIOLOGICAL   → How to administer (bathing, circulation)
  RECIPE       → How to prepare the compounds
