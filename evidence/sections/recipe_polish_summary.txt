================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The recipe/pharmaceutical section is the PRACTICAL CORE of the manuscript:

1. **HIGHEST INSTRUCTION DENSITY** - 428 dar/dal lines (25.1% of text!)
   This section tells practitioners HOW to prepare medicines

2. **HIGHEST OIL VOCABULARY** - 1,432 oil-related words (10.0%)
   Oil is the primary base for pharmaceutical preparations

3. **MODERATE POLISH %** (10.3%) - Between rosettes and herbal
   Instruction verbs dominate, fewer patient references

4. **FORMULA STRUCTURE** - Clear pattern:
   INGREDIENT + PREPARATION + METHOD + PURPOSE

5. **BOTANICAL PARTS** - References plants by PART (leaf, root, flower)
   not by NAME, for compound preparation

6. **COMPLETION OF WORKFLOW:**
   - Herbal identifies plants for conditions
   - Astronomical determines timing
   - Biological describes administration
   - Rosettes provides theoretical framework
   - F87 bridges theory to practice
   - **Recipe provides preparation instructions**

The recipe section is the CULMINATION of the manuscript's medical system,
providing detailed compound preparation instructions that integrate
knowledge from all preceding sections.
