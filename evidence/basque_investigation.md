# Investigation: Basque Connection to Voynich

## Background

Basque (Euskara) is uniquely interesting:

1. **Language isolate** - not related to any known language family
2. **Pre-Indo-European** - survived in Western Europe
3. **Agglutinative** - suffix-heavy like Voynich
4. **15th century presence** - spoken during manuscript's era
5. **Geographic location** - Iberian Peninsula/Southern France

Basque has complex verb morphology and extensive case suffixes, making it a relevant test.

## Test 1: Basque Vocabulary Matches

### Significant Matches Found

| Voynich | Count | Basque | Meaning |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| orain | 25 | orain | **now** (temporal) |
| odol | 2 | odol | **blood** |
| ol | 525 | ol | board, plank |
| or | 350 | or | dog (dialectal) |
| ar | 346 | ar | male (word/suffix) |
| al | 253 | al | can, ability |
| sar | 83 | sar- | to enter (verb root) |
| sal | 54 | sal- | to sell (verb root) |
| lor | 43 | lor- | to achieve (verb root) |
| kar | 52 | kar/gar | flame |
| kor | 25 | -kor | prone to (suffix) |
| tar | 43 | -tar | native of (suffix) |
| lar | 6 | lar | pasture, meadow |
| da | 8 | da | is (verb "to be") |
| oin | 5 | oin | **foot** |
| oro | 6 | oro | all, every |
| adar | 1 | adar | branch, horn |

**17 vocabulary matches** - EQUAL to Turkish!

### Notable Specific Matches

1. **orain** (25) = "now" - temporal adverb
2. **odol** (2) = "blood" - body term
3. **oin** (5) = "foot" - body part
4. **oro** (6) = "all, every" - quantifier

These are NOT shared with Turkish/Hungarian - uniquely Basque!

## Test 2: Basque-Specific Words NOT Shared with Other Languages

| Voynich | Basque | Turkish | Hungarian | Unique? |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| orain | now | - | - | **YES** |
| odol | blood | - | - | **YES** |
| oin | foot | - | - | **YES** |
| oro | all | - | - | **YES** |
| adar | branch | - | - | **YES** |
| lar | meadow | - | - | **YES** |

**6 words unique to Basque** - not found in other candidate languages!

## Test 3: Basque Case Suffixes

Basque has extensive case marking:

| Suffix | Case | Voynich Count |
|--------|------|---------------|
| -a | Absolutive singular | NOT as case marker |
| -ak | Absolutive plural | **0** |
| -ek | Ergative plural | **0** |
| -aren | Genitive singular | **0** |
| -ari | Dative singular | **0** |
| -ekin | Comitative | **0** |
| -tik | Ablative | **0** |
| -ra | Allative | **0** |

**Result: NO Basque case suffixes found.**

## Test 4: Basque Verb Auxiliaries

Basque has complex verb agreement:

| Auxiliary | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| da | is | 8 ✓ |
| du | has | 0 |
| dut | I have | 0 |
| dira | they are | 0 |
| naiz | I am | 0 |
| gara | we are | 0 |

Only "da" (8) found - but "da" is common across many languages.

---

## Test 5: Morphology Check

### Does Basque 'orain' (now) take Basque or Voynich suffixes?

**Basque forms of 'orain':**
| Form | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|------|---------|---------------|
| orain | now | 25 ✓ |
| oraingo | current | 0 |
| oraindik | still | 0 |
| oraintxe | right now | 0 |

**Actual Voynich 'orain-' forms:**
| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| orain | 25 | base |
| orainchdyshdy | 1 | orain + Voynich suffix |
| orainor | 1 | orain + -or (Voynich) |

**Result: 'orain' takes VOYNICH suffixes, not Basque suffixes.**

---

## Test 6: Phonological Comparison

### Basque Phonology

Basque uses:
- tx for "ch" sound (txori = bird)
- x for "sh" sound (xagu = mouse)
- tz for "ts" sound
- ts for affricate

### Voynich Phonology

Voynich has:
- ch (1696 tokens)
- sh (1072 tokens)
- No tx, x, tz, ts patterns

**Result: Phonological systems differ.**

## Comparison: Basque vs Top Candidates

| Feature | Basque | Turkish | Hungarian |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Total vocab matches | **17** | **17+** | 12 |
| Unique matches | **6** | ~5 | ~3 |
| Morphology type | Agglutinative | Agglutinative | Agglutinative |
| Case suffixes | NOT found | NOT found | NOT found |
| Grammar match | NO | NO | NO |
| Geographic fit | Western Europe | Central Asia | Central Europe |

## Historical Context

### Basque in the 15th Century

- Spoken in Kingdom of Navarre
- Basque Country straddled Castile and France
- Trade connections to Mediterranean
- Some Basque sailors and merchants traveled widely

### Possible Connection Points

1. **Iberian Peninsula**: Manuscript possibly connected to Spanish/Portuguese trade
2. **Navigation**: Basque whalers known for long-distance voyages
3. **Trade**: Basque merchants active in medieval Europe
4. **Isolation**: Basque communities maintained distinct language

---

## Analysis: Why Basque Shows Strong Matches

### Theory 1: Trade Contact

Basque merchants may have contributed vocabulary to a trade pidgin used along European routes.

### Theory 2: Coincidental CV Patterns

Many matches are simple CV syllables:
- ol, or, ar, al, sar, sal, lor, kar, kor

These exist in multiple languages.

### Theory 3: Pre-Indo-European Substrate

If Voynich encodes a very old language or constructed language based on ancient roots, Basque (as a pre-Indo-European survivor) might share ancient vocabulary.

### Theory 4: Unique Matches are Significant

The words **orain**, **odol**, **oin**, **oro** are NOT found in Turkish/Hungarian. This suggests possible genuine Basque connection rather than coincidence.

## Updated Language Ranking

| Rank | Language | Vocab Matches | Unique Matches |
|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Turkish** | **17+** | ~5 |
| 1 | **Basque** | **17** | **6** |
| 3 | Hungarian | 12 | ~3 |
| 4 | Korean | 10 | ~2 |
| 5 | Mongolian | 8 | ~1 |
| 6 | Old Turkic | 7 | - |
| 7 | Armenian | 6 | ~1 |
| 8 | Polish | 3-4 | 0 |
| 9 | Georgian | 3 | 0 |

**Basque ties with Turkish for most vocabulary matches!**

## Conclusion

### Basque Hypothesis: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Vocabulary matches | **17** (tied for #1) |
| Unique matches | **6** (best result) |
| Case suffixes | NOT found |
| Verb auxiliaries | 1 (weak) |
| Grammar | NOT Basque |

### Significance

Basque shows:
1. **Equal vocabulary matches to Turkish** (17)
2. **MORE unique matches** than any other language (6)
3. **Geographic plausibility** for Western European origin
4. **Same pattern**: vocabulary matches, grammar doesn't

### The Emerging Picture

Three language groups show significant vocabulary overlap:
1. **Turkic/Altaic** (Turkish, Mongolian, Korean)
2. **Uralic** (Hungarian)
3. **Basque** (language isolate)

These are all:
- **Agglutinative** languages
- **Non-Indo-European** (or peripherally IE)
- Languages that maintained distinct identities in medieval Europe

### Hypothesis: Multi-Source Vocabulary

The Voynich manuscript may contain vocabulary from multiple language sources, unified under a unique grammatical system. This would explain:
- Turkish matches (trade language)
- Hungarian matches (Central European)
- Basque matches (Western European)
- Unique grammar (constructed/pidgin)
