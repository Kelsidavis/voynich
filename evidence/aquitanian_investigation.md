# Investigation: Aquitanian Connection to Voynich

## Background

Aquitanian is extremely significant:

1. **Ancestor of Basque** - pre-Roman language of southwestern Gaul
2. **Language isolate lineage** - not Indo-European
3. **Known only from inscriptions** - ~400 personal names and deity names
4. **Roman-era attestation** - 1st-3rd century CE inscriptions
5. **Agglutinative features** - similar structure to Basque

If Voynich has Basque connections, Aquitanian could reveal deeper roots.

## Test 1: Direct Aquitanian Vocabulary

### Searching Attested Words

| Aquitanian | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| nescato | girl | 0 |
| cison | man | 0 |
| sembe | son | 0 |
| andere | lady | 0 |
| sahar | old | 0 |
| belex/beles | black | 0 |
| gorri | red | 0 |
| osso/oxso | wolf | 0 |
| aher | goat | 0 |

**Result: NO direct Aquitanian words found.**

### Searching Deity Names

| Deity | Voynich Count |
|-------|---------------|
| abellio | 0 |
| aherbelste | 0 |
| artahe | 0 |
| ilunno | 0 |
| astoilun | 0 |

**Result: NO Aquitanian deity names found.**

## Test 2: Aquitanian Elements in Voynich

### Root Elements

| Element | Aquitanian | Basque | Voynich Count |
|---------|------------|--------|---------------|
| ar | male | ar | 346 |
| or | - | or | 350 |
| -tar | from/native | -tar | 43 |
| sar | - | sar- (enter) | 83 |

These match what we found in Basque testing.

### The Aquitanian-Basque-Voynich Connection

Since Aquitanian → Basque, the matches are the same:

| Voynich | Basque | Aquitanian Origin? |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| orain (25) | orain (now) | Unknown |
| odol (2) | odol (blood) | Likely |
| oin (5) | oin (foot) | Likely |
| oro (6) | oro (all) | Unknown |
| ar (346) | ar (male) | **YES** (Hars-) |
| tar (43) | -tar (from) | **YES** (-tar) |

---

## Test 3: Why Direct Matches Are Unlikely

### The Corpus Problem

Aquitanian is known from only:
- ~400 personal names
- ~50 deity names
- A few suffixes and elements

This is NOT a vocabulary - it's onomastic (naming) data.

### What We Can't Test

| Category | Aquitanian Data | Testable? |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Common nouns | Almost none | NO |
| Verbs | None | NO |
| Adjectives | A few (in names) | Limited |
| Numbers | None | NO |
| Function words | None | NO |
| Plants/herbs | None | NO |

The manuscript's botanical/medical content CANNOT be matched to Aquitanian because we have no Aquitanian plant vocabulary.

---

## Test 4: Structural Comparison

### Aquitanian Name Structure

Aquitanian names show agglutinative patterns:
- Hars-ciso = male + man
- Andere-ni = lady + diminutive?
- Sefo-tar = wild + from

### Voynich Structure

Voynich shows similar agglutination:
- qo- + root + -aiin
- prefix + root + suffix

**Structural similarity exists**, but this is also true for Basque and Turkish.

## Analysis: Aquitanian as Proto-Basque

### The Relationship

```
Aquitanian (1st-3rd c. CE)
     ↓
Proto-Basque
     ↓
Medieval Basque (15th c.)
     ↓
Modern Basque
```

### Implications for Voynich

If Voynich shows Basque vocabulary (17 matches, 6 unique), it **implicitly** shows Aquitanian heritage.

The words:
- orain (now)
- odol (blood)
- oin (foot)
- ar (male)

...would have Aquitanian ancestors, even if we can't attest them directly.

## Comparison: Aquitanian vs Basque

| Feature | Aquitanian | Basque | Voynich |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|
| Attested vocabulary | ~50 elements | Full language | 8474 types |
| Direct matches | 0 | 17 | - |
| Testable | Very limited | Full | Full |
| Time period | 1st-3rd c. | 15th c. onward | 15th c. |

**Basque is the better test** because:
1. Far more vocabulary attested
2. Contemporary with manuscript
3. Same linguistic lineage

---

## Historical Context

### Aquitanian Territory

Roman-era Aquitania covered:
- Modern Gascony
- Parts of Pyrenees
- Northern Basque Country

### Survival into Medieval Period

Aquitanian → Proto-Basque → Medieval Basque

By the 15th century (Voynich era), Aquitanian had evolved into Basque. Testing Basque IS testing the Aquitanian lineage.

## Conclusion

### Aquitanian Hypothesis: INCONCLUSIVE (Not Rejectable)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Direct vocabulary | 0 matches (limited corpus) |
| Deity names | 0 matches |
| Root elements | Same as Basque |
| Structure | Compatible |

### Why We Can't Reject Aquitanian

1. **Corpus too limited** - only names, no vocabulary
2. **Basque is the proxy** - testing Basque tests Aquitanian lineage
3. **Structural match** - agglutinative like Voynich

### Why We Can't Confirm Aquitanian

1. **No unique evidence** - everything matches Basque
2. **No botanical vocabulary** - can't test manuscript content
3. **Time gap** - 1000+ years before manuscript

### Final Assessment

**Aquitanian is effectively tested through Basque.**

The 17 Basque vocabulary matches (6 unique) represent the Aquitanian linguistic lineage. We cannot independently test Aquitanian due to the limited corpus.

## Updated Ranking

| Rank | Language | Matches | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Turkish | 17+ | Agglutinative, Central Asian |
| 1 | **Basque/Aquitanian** | **17** | Agglutinative, W. European isolate |
| 3 | Hungarian | 12 | Agglutinative, Central European |
| 4 | Korean | 10 | Altaic |
| 5 | Gascon | 10 | Romance (no unique) |
| 6 | Mongolian | 8 | Altaic |

The Basque connection (which includes Aquitanian heritage) remains tied for strongest vocabulary match.
