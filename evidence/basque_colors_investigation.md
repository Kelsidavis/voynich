### Potential Match: "ory" = "hori" (yellow)

| Voynich | Count | Basque | Analysis |

|-------|---------|---------|
| f40r | Herbal | `toar.ykaiin.ory.dal` - plant description |
| f79r | Biological | `olkaiin.ol.ory.chol` - with "chol" (flower?) |

## The "ory" = "hori" Hypothesis

### Phonetic Analysis

| Feature | Basque "hori" | Voynich "ory" |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Initial h | Often silent | Absent (expected) |
| Core | ori | or |
| Final vowel | i | y (common Voynich suffix) |

**The h-dropping is consistent with many Basque dialects.**

### Semantic Appropriateness

Yellow is highly relevant in a herbal manuscript:
- Yellow flowers (dandelion, buttercup, etc.)
- Yellow roots (turmeric, ginger)
- Yellowing of leaves (medical diagnosis)
- Yellow bile (humoral medicine)

### Derivatives

| Form | Analysis | Meaning? |
|------|----------|----------|
| ory | Base | yellow |
| oriin | ory + -iin | yellow-CASE |
| oriim | ory + -iim | yellow-? |

**Basque root + Voynich suffixes** - consistent with botanical/body findings!

## Evidence Assessment

### Color Test Results

| Language | Colors Found | Confidence |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Basque** | **1 (hori→ory)** | **MODERATE** |
| Turkish | 0-1 (weak) | LOW |
| Hebrew | 0-1 (weak) | LOW |
| Latin | 0 | NONE |

### Missing Colors - Interpretation

| Missing | Possible Explanation |
|---------|---------------------|
| gorri (red) | Different word in sister language |
| zuri (white) | Different word in sister language |
| beltz (black) | Different word in sister language |
| berde (green) | Different word in sister language |

**The pattern matches botanical/body findings**: Some Basque vocabulary shared, most diverged.

## Comparison with Other Semantic Domains

| Domain | Basque Matches | Pattern |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Botanical | 5 (lor, olo, ota, lar, adar) | PARTIAL |
| Body parts | 3 (oin, soin, odol) | PARTIAL |
| Temporal | 1 (orain) | SINGLE |
| **Colors** | **1 (ory=hori?)** | **PARTIAL** |
| Numbers | 0 | ABSENT |

**Colors follow the same pattern as other domains**: Some shared, most different.

## Conclusion

### Basque Colors Test: ONE POSSIBLE MATCH

| Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| "ory" = "hori" (yellow) | **POSSIBLE** (17 tokens) |
| Other colors | 0 found |
| Pattern | Consistent with sister language |

### Evidence Rating: WEAK-MODERATE

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Phonetic match | MODERATE (h-dropping normal) |
| Frequency | LOW-MODERATE (17 tokens) |
| Context | MODERATE (appears in herbal section) |
| Derivatives | WEAK (few forms) |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **SUPPORTS** (weakly) | One color match, others different |
| Consistent pattern | Same as botanical/body domains |
| Not conclusive | Single match could be coincidence |

### Updated Evidence Summary

| Category | Basque Matches | Tokens | Confidence |
|----------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Botanical | 5 | 56 | HIGH |
| Body parts | 3 | 11 | MODERATE |
| Temporal | 1 | 25 | HIGH |
| Core vocab | 17 | ~1500 | MODERATE |
| **Colors** | **1?** | **17** | **WEAK-MODERATE** |
| Numbers | 0 | 0 | N/A |

**Total semantic domain evidence**: Botanical, body parts, temporal, and possibly one color term support the Pre-IE hypothesis. Numbers remain absent.
