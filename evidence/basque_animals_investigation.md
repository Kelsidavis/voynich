# Basque Animal Words in Voynich Manuscript

## Test Purpose

If Voynich is related to Basque, we might find Basque animal vocabulary in:
- Herbal sections (animals associated with plants)
- Biological sections (anatomical references)
- Any zoological descriptions

## Summary: Animal Vocabulary Across Languages

| Language | Animal Matches | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Basque** | **1 (or=dog)** | Already in core vocabulary |
| **Hebrew** | **1-2 (shor=ox, dag=fish?)** | Already identified |
| **Hungarian** | **1 (lo=horse)** | Already identified |
| Turkish | 0 | No matches |
| Latin | 0 | No matches |

**Total unique animal terms: 3-4** (all previously identified)

## Analysis

### Why So Few Animal Terms?

Possible explanations:

1. **Herbal/medical focus**: The manuscript is primarily botanical/medical, not zoological
2. **Limited animal content**: Few illustrations depict animals
3. **Different terminology**: Sister language used completely different animal words
4. **Symbolic/encoded**: Animal references may not be literal

### Comparison with Other Semantic Domains

| Domain | Basque Matches | Total Matches | Type |
|--------|----------------|---------------|------|
| Botanical | 5 | 5 | Concrete |
| Body parts | 3 | 3 | Concrete |
| Colors | 1? | 1? | Concrete |
| **Animals** | **1** | **3-4** | **Concrete** |
| Numbers | 0 | 0 | Abstract |
| Celestial | 0 | 0 | Abstract |

Animals fall in the **concrete** category but show fewer matches than botanical/body terms.

### Interpretation

The animal domain shows:
- **1 Basque match** (or=dog) - from core vocabulary
- **2-3 non-Basque matches** (shor=Hebrew ox, lo=Hungarian horse)
- **Most Basque animal vocabulary absent**

This is consistent with:
- A manuscript focused on plants, not animals
- Vocabulary borrowing from multiple sources (Basque, Hebrew, Hungarian)
- OR complete divergence in animal terminology

## Pattern Analysis: Concrete Vocabulary Breakdown

| Concrete Domain | Matches | Frequency |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| Botanical | 5 | HIGH (56 tokens) |
| Body parts | 3 | MODERATE (11 tokens) |
| Animals | 1-4 | LOW (varies) |
| Colors | 1? | LOW (17 tokens) |

**Botanical terms dominate** - appropriate for an herbal manuscript.

## Conclusion

### Basque Animals Test: MINIMAL MATCHES

| Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Basque animal terms | 1 (or=dog, already known) |
| New Basque animals | 0 found |
| Other language animals | 2-3 (shor, lo) |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Manuscript is botanical, not zoological |
| Consistent | Animal vocabulary not expected to be prominent |
| Pattern holds | Concrete domain with limited matches |

### Updated Semantic Domain Summary

| Domain | Basque | Status | Type | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Botanical | 5 | CONFIRMED | Concrete | PRIMARY focus |
| Body parts | 3 | CONFIRMED | Concrete | Medical focus |
| Temporal | 1 | CONFIRMED | Semi-abstract | - |
| Colors | 1? | POSSIBLE | Concrete | - |
| Animals | 1 | MINIMAL | Concrete | Not manuscript focus |
| Numbers | 0 | ABSENT | Abstract | - |
| Celestial | 0 | ABSENT | Abstract | - |

**The limited animal vocabulary is consistent with the manuscript's botanical/medical focus, not evidence against the Pre-IE hypothesis.**
