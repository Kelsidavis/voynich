# Investigation: What does 'chor' actually mean?

## Previous Claim (v7.5 decoder)

| Word | Claimed Meaning | Significance |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| chor | Polish 'chory' (sick person) | "THE CORE DISCOVERY" |

This was presented as key evidence that transformed the manuscript from nonsense into coherent medical recipes. The claim: previous readers misread 'chor' as Latin 'cherub', but it's actually Polish 'chory' (sick).

## Evidence Against the Polish 'sick' Hypothesis

### 1. Polish Paradigm Test: FAILED

If 'chor' = Polish 'chory', we should see Polish case forms:

| Form | Case | Expected | Corpus Count |
|------|------|----------|--------------|
| chory | nom. masc. | ✓ | 10 |
| chora | nom. fem. | ✓ | **0** |
| chore | nom. neut. | ✓ | **0** |
| chorzy | nom. plur. | ✓ | **0** |
| chorego | genitive | ✓ | **0** |
| choremu | dative | ✓ | **0** |

**Result:** 5 of 6 Polish forms are completely absent.

The single 'chory' (10x) could simply be chor + y (Voynich suffix), not Polish nominative.

### 2. Morphological Analysis: 'chor' = 'ch' + '-or'

The root 'ch' takes ALL standard Voynich suffixes:

| Form | Count | Structure |
|------|-------|-----------|
| chedy | 496 | ch + edy |
| chol | 381 | ch + ol |
| chey | 339 | ch + ey |
| chor | 206 | ch + or |
| chdy | 145 | ch + dy |
| chy | 136 | ch + y |
| char | 71 | ch + ar |
| chal | 46 | ch + al |
| chaiin | 41 | ch + aiin |

**Critical problem:** If 'chol' = flower and 'chor' = sick, then the ROOT 'ch' would have to mean two completely different things depending on suffix. That makes no linguistic sense.

**174 stems** in the corpus take BOTH -or and -ol suffixes. These are productive grammatical suffixes, not meaning-bearing elements.

### 3. Distribution Test: WRONG SECTION

| Word | Herbal | Astro | Bio | Rosettes | Recipe |
|------|--------|-------|-----|----------|--------|
| chor | **14.8** | 1.7 | 0.1 | 2.8 | 3.3 |
| chol | **22.7** | 5.7 | 2.1 | 5.5 | 8.3 |

**Both** 'chor' and 'chol' peak in the HERBAL section.

If 'chor' = 'sick person', it should cluster in RECIPE (medical instructions), not HERBAL (plant descriptions).

Why would "sick person" be most common in botanical descriptions?

### 4. Context Test: SIMILAR CONTEXTS

'chor' and 'chol' share 34-35% of their context words.

They frequently appear **adjacent** to each other:
- 'chol' immediately before 'chor': 5 times
- 'chor' immediately before 'chol': 9 times
- 'chol' immediately after 'chor': 9 times
- 'chor' immediately after 'chol': 5 times

If they meant different things (sick vs flower), they should appear in different contexts. Instead, they cluster together like grammatical variants of the same word.

### 5. Actual 'chor-' forms in corpus

| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| chor | 206 | ch + or |
| chory | 10 | ch + or + y (NOT Polish chory) |
| choraiin | 4 | chor + aiin |
| choror | 3 | chor + or (double suffix) |
| chorol | 3 | chor + ol (double suffix) |
| chordy | 2 | chor + dy |
| chorain | 2 | chor + ain |

These forms follow **Voynich morphology** (adding -aiin, -ain, -dy), not Polish morphology.

## Conclusion

### What 'chor' is NOT:
- ✗ Polish 'chory' (sick)
- ✗ A patient reference in medical recipes
- ✗ Independent from 'chol'
- ✗ Evidence of Polish authorship

### What 'chor' likely IS:
- ✓ The root 'ch' + suffix '-or'
- ✓ A grammatical variant of the same root as 'chol' (ch + ol)
- ✓ Something related to the herbal/botanical domain
- ✓ Exact meaning: **UNKNOWN**

### The root 'ch':
The root 'ch' (and its variant 'che') is one of the most productive in the corpus:
- Total tokens across all forms: ~1,900
- Clusters heavily in herbal section
- Takes all standard Voynich suffixes
- Probably means something botanical (flower? plant? herb?)

### Hypothesis Status

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Polish paradigm | **FAILED** (5/6 forms missing) |
| Distribution | **FAILED** (peaks in herbal, not recipe) |
| Morphology | **CONTRADICTS** (same root as 'chol') |
| Context | **CONTRADICTS** (similar to 'chol') |

**OVERALL: REJECTED**

The claim that 'chor' = Polish 'chory' (sick person) is **not supported** by the corpus evidence.

This was presented as the "core discovery" of the decoder, but it appears to be a **false etymology** based on superficial phonetic similarity. The evidence shows 'chor' is simply 'ch' + '-or', a grammatical form of the same root that gives us 'chol', 'chedy', 'chey', etc.

## Implications

The v7.5 decoder's central claim has collapsed:
- 'chor' ≠ Polish 'chory' (sick)
- 'dar' ≠ Polish 'dać' (give)
- 'dal' ≠ Polish 'dał' (gave)

These three words were the **primary evidence** for the Polish medical instruction hypothesis. All three have been falsified by corpus analysis.

The manuscript may still contain Polish elements, but the core vocabulary evidence has not survived rigorous testing.
