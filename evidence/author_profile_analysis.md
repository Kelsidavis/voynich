## Author Profile: What We Can Infer

### 1. Native Language

**The author's first language was likely:**
- A Pre-Indo-European language
- Related to (but not identical to) Basque
- Possibly the last speaker(s) of a dying language
- A language that had absorbed loanwords from multiple sources

**Evidence:**
- 16-19 Basque cognates in semantically appropriate contexts
- Unique grammatical system (not Basque grammar)
- Content vocabulary shared, function words different

### 2. Geographic Origin

**Most likely regions:**

| Region | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Pyrenees/Northern Iberia** | Basque connection | No Spanish/Catalan |
| **Southern France** | Near Basque zone | No French/Occitan |
| **Northern Italy** | Manuscript provenance | No Italian/Latin |
| **Central Europe** | Hungarian vocabulary | Far from Basque |

**Best hypothesis**: Western Mediterranean, possibly:
- Pyrenean foothills
- Gascon region
- Northern Aragon
- A trade route community

### 3. Professional Knowledge

**The author had expertise in:**

| Domain | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Herbalism/Botany** | 5 plant terms, herbal section focus | HIGH |
| **Medicine** | "osaiin" (heal), "dam" (blood), "sam" (drug) | HIGH |
| **Anatomy** | Body part terms in biological sections | MODERATE |
| **Practical trades** | "sar" (enter), "sal" (sell) | MODERATE |

**NOT evident:**
- Astronomy (no celestial vocabulary found)
- Mathematics (no number words)
- Theology (no religious terms)
- Literature (no literary vocabulary)

### 4. Social Position

**What the language suggests:**

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Literate** | Created a complex manuscript |
| **Specialized knowledge** | Botanical/medical vocabulary |
| **Trade connections** | Semitic commercial terms, Turkic words |
| **Not university-educated** | No Latin, no scholastic vocabulary |
| **Not clergy** | No religious terms, no Latin prayers |
| **Possibly female?** | Herbal medicine was often women's domain |

**Possible occupations:**
- Herbalist / healer
- Apothecary
- Midwife
- Merchant with medical goods
- Folk medicine practitioner

### 5. Cultural Position

**The author was likely:**

| Characteristic | Evidence |
|----------------|----------|
| **Marginalized linguistically** | Spoke dying/minority language |
| **Outside mainstream education** | No Latin influence |
| **Connected to trade networks** | Multi-language vocabulary |
| **Preserving traditional knowledge** | Herbal/medical focus |
| **Possibly persecuted group?** | Hidden/unreadable text |

---

## The "Last Speaker" Hypothesis

### Could the author have been among the last speakers of this language?

**Evidence FOR:**
- Language shows signs of heavy borrowing (dying languages absorb words)
- No other texts in this language survive
- Manuscript may be deliberate preservation effort
- 15th century = period of linguistic homogenization in Europe

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- Manuscript is lengthy and complex (not a rushed recording)
- Multiple hands may have contributed
- Could be community effort, not individual

### The Preservation Motive

If the author knew their language was dying, the manuscript might be:
- A medical/herbal knowledge compendium
- A record of traditional practices
- An attempt to preserve linguistic heritage
- A teaching text for the next generation

### Speculative Profile

> A 15th-century herbalist or healer from the Pyrenean region or western Mediterranean, speaking a dying Pre-Indo-European language related to Basque. Likely not formally educated in Latin or university systems, but possessed extensive traditional knowledge of plants and medicine. May have had connections to trade networks (Semitic, Turkic vocabulary), possibly through a merchant community or trade route settlement. Created the manuscript to preserve medical/herbal knowledge in their native language, either for personal use, teaching, or deliberate preservation of a dying tradition.

## Key Insights

### 1. The Author Was Linguistically Unusual

In 15th-century Europe, most literate people knew Latin. This author:
- Wrote in a non-Indo-European language
- Had no apparent Latin education
- Was connected to eastern trade vocabulary
- Was isolated from Romance language influence

**This is highly unusual and narrows possible profiles significantly.**

### 2. The Author Had Specialized Knowledge

The vocabulary confirms expertise in:
- Plant identification and properties
- Medical/healing practices
- Body/anatomy (at least basic)

**This was a practical professional, not a theoretical scholar.**

### 3. The Author's Language Was Dying

The pattern of:
- Core Pre-IE vocabulary
- Heavy borrowing from contact languages
- Unique (possibly simplified?) grammar
- No other surviving texts

...suggests a language in its final generations.

### 4. The Manuscript May Be Deliberate Preservation

Given the dying language hypothesis, the manuscript might represent:
- A conscious effort to record knowledge
- The last written record of a linguistic tradition
- A heritage document for a disappearing community

---

## Conclusion

### The Voynich Author Profile

**Most likely**: A 15th-century healer or herbalist from the western Mediterranean region, speaking a Pre-Indo-European language related to Basque that was in its final stages of use. Not formally educated in the Latin tradition, but possessing extensive practical knowledge of plants and medicine. Connected through trade networks to eastern (Turkic/Hungarian) and Mediterranean (Semitic) linguistic communities. Created the manuscript either for professional use or to preserve traditional knowledge in a dying language.

**The author was not**:
- A medieval scholar
- A cipher creator
- A hoaxer
- A mainstream religious figure

**The manuscript represents**: Possibly one of the last documents of an extinct Pre-Indo-European language, preserving herbal and medical knowledge from a tradition that did not survive into the modern era.
