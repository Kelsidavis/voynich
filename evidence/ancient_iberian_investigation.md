# Investigation: Ancient Iberian Languages Connection to Voynich

## Background

Testing pre-Roman and ancient languages of the Iberian Peninsula:

1. **Iberian** - Pre-Roman language of eastern/southern Spain
   - Known from ~2000 inscriptions
   - Script deciphered, language only partially understood
   - NOT related to Basque (despite old theories)
   - 6th-1st century BCE

2. **Phoenician/Punic** - Semitic language of Phoenician colonizers
   - Related to Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic
   - Colonies: Gadir (Cadiz), Carthago Nova, Ibiza
   - 9th century BCE - 2nd century CE

3. **Tartessian** - Mysterious language of southwestern Iberia
   - Related to Phoenician contact zone
   - Very poorly understood

## Test 1: Iberian Vocabulary

### Known Iberian Elements (from inscriptions)

| Iberian | Possible Meaning | Voynich Count |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| ekiar | made/did | 0 |
| seltar | tomb? | 0 |
| neitin | deity | 0 |
| iltir/iltur | city | 0 |
| beles | name element | 0 |
| sakar | element | **1** |
| -sken | people of | 0 |

**Result: 1 weak match (sakar).**

### Common Syllable Patterns

Many Iberian inscriptions use CV+C patterns:

| Pattern | Iberian Use | Voynich Count |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| tar | suffix | 43 |
| sar | element | 83 |
| kar | element | 52 |
| kor | element | 25 |
| sal | element | 54 |
| kal | element | 23 |

These match but are common across many languages.

### Assessment: Iberian

**INCONCLUSIVE** - The Iberian corpus is:
- Partially deciphered (we can read, not fully understand)
- Limited vocabulary knowledge
- No botanical/medical terminology known

## Test 2: Phoenician/Punic Vocabulary

### Semitic Word Matches

| Voynich | Count | Phoenician/Hebrew | Meaning |
|---------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| dam | 89 | dam (דם) | **blood** |
| adam | 2 | adam (אדם) | **man** |
| am | 87 | am (אם/עם) | mother/people |
| em | 1 | em (אם) | mother |
| dor | 70 | dor (דור) | generation |
| shor | 92 | shor (שור) | **ox/bull** |
| sham | 7 | sham (שם) | there/name |
| dom | 6 | adom (אדום) | red |

**8 vocabulary matches** with Semitic languages!

### Significant Matches

1. **dam (89) = blood** - Very significant for a medical manuscript
2. **adam (2) = man** - Common Semitic word
3. **shor (92) = ox/bull** - Agricultural term
4. **dor (70) = generation** - Hebrew word

### Related Forms in Voynich

| Voynich | Count | Analysis |
|---------|-------|----------|
| odam | 4 | o- + dam (blood) |
| dam | 89 | Semitic "blood" |
| daim | ? | dam + Voynich suffix? |

---

## Test 3: Phoenician Deity Names

| Deity | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Baal | lord | 0 |
| Tanit | goddess | 0 |
| Melqart | king of city | 0 |
| Eshmun | healing god | 0 |
| Astarte | goddess | 0 |

**Result: NO deity names found.**

---

## Test 4: Semitic Root Patterns

Semitic languages use triconsonantal roots (C-C-C):
- d-m = blood (dam, adom, edom)
- sh-r = ox (shor), sing (shir)
- d-r = generation (dor), dwell (dar)

### Testing Root Patterns

| Root | Forms in Voynich | Semitic Meaning |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| d-m | dam (89), dom (6) | blood, red |
| sh-r | shor (92), shar (32) | ox, prince |
| d-r | dar (297), dor (70) | generation?, dwell? |
| k-l | kol (37), kal (23) | all, voice |

### Problem: Same as Other Languages

| Voynich | Hebrew | Turkish | Hungarian |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| dar | dwell? | narrow | - |
| kol | all | arm | - |
| dam | blood | - | - |
| shor | ox | - | - |

"dam" and "shor" are MORE specific to Hebrew/Phoenician.

## Test 5: Tartessian

Tartessian is barely understood. No testable vocabulary.

| Element | Voynich Count |
|---------|---------------|
| lokob | 0 |
| naŕke | 0 |
| iru | 0 |

**Result: UNTESTABLE.**

## Comparison: Ancient vs Modern Languages

| Language | Matches | Unique | Era |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Turkish | 17+ | ~5 | Modern |
| Basque | 17 | 6 | Ancient/Modern |
| Hungarian | 12 | ~3 | Medieval/Modern |
| **Phoenician/Hebrew** | **8** | **2-3** | Ancient |
| Gascon | 10 | 0 | Medieval |
| Iberian | 1 | 0 | Ancient |

### Unique Phoenician/Hebrew Matches

Words NOT found in Turkish/Basque/Hungarian:

| Voynich | Phoenician/Hebrew | Meaning |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| dam | dam | blood |
| shor | shor | ox |
| adam | adam | man |

These are specifically Semitic!

---

## Analysis: The Semitic Connection

### Why dam (blood) Matters

- **89 occurrences** - moderately frequent
- **Medical manuscript** - blood is relevant topic
- **NOT in other candidates** - Turkish/Basque/Hungarian don't have "dam"

### Historical Context

Phoenician influence in Iberia:
- Gadir (Cadiz) founded ~1100 BCE
- Carthaginian Spain (3rd century BCE)
- Jewish communities in Iberia (Sephardic)
- Hebrew manuscripts in medieval Spain

### Could There Be Hebrew/Phoenician Substrate?

If the Voynich author had contact with:
- Sephardic Jewish communities in Spain
- Hebrew medical texts
- Old Phoenician/Punic inscriptions

...this could explain Semitic vocabulary alongside Basque/Turkish.

## The Emerging Multi-Layer Pattern

| Layer | Languages | Matches | Feature |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Turkish/Altaic | 17+ | Agglutinative core |
| 2 | Basque | 17 | W. European isolate |
| 3 | Hungarian | 12 | Central European |
| 4 | **Hebrew/Phoenician** | **8** | Semitic substrate |
| 5 | Iberian | 1 | Too fragmentary |

---

## Conclusion

### Iberian: INCONCLUSIVE

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Vocabulary | 1 match (weak) |
| Inscriptional elements | Minimal |
| Decipherment status | Partial |

Cannot be properly tested due to limited corpus.

### Phoenician/Hebrew: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Vocabulary | **8 matches** |
| Unique matches | **2-3** (dam, shor, adam) |
| Deity names | 0 |
| Root patterns | Some evidence |

**Significant finding:** dam (blood), shor (ox), adam (man) are specifically Semitic and NOT found in other candidate languages.

### Updated Full Ranking

| Rank | Language | Matches | Unique | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Turkish | 17+ | ~5 | Agglutinative |
| 1 | Basque | 17 | 6 | W. European isolate |
| 3 | Hungarian | 12 | ~3 | Central European |
| 4 | Korean | 10 | ~2 | Altaic |
| 5 | Gascon | 10 | 0 | Romance |
| 6 | **Phoenician/Hebrew** | **8** | **2-3** | **Semitic** |
| 7 | Mongolian | 8 | ~1 | Altaic |
| 8 | Armenian | 6 | ~1 | Caucasian |
| 9 | Iberian | 1 | 0 | Too fragmentary |

### Hypothesis: Multi-Source Vocabulary

The Voynich vocabulary may draw from:

1. **Turkic/Altaic** core (trade language)
2. **Basque** (Western European)
3. **Hungarian** (Central European)
4. **Semitic** substrate (Hebrew/Phoenician via Iberian contact)

All unified under a **unique Voynich grammar** that matches none of these.
