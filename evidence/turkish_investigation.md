# Investigation: Turkish Connection to Voynich

## Why Test Turkish?

Turkish is an **agglutinative** language (suffix-heavy), which structurally matches Voynich better than any Indo-European language tested so far.

Key Turkish features:
- Suffix-based morphology (like Voynich)
- Vowel harmony (front/back vowels must agree)
- Subject-Object-Verb word order
- No grammatical gender
- No articles (definite/indefinite)

### Additional Verb-Like Matches

| Voynich | Count | Turkish | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| olar | 11 | olar | they become |
| alar | 6 | alar | they take |
| dolar | 2 | dolar | it fills |
| salar | 2 | salar | it releases |
| dalar | 5 | dalar | he/she dives |

**This is MORE vocabulary matches than any other language tested!**

## Test 2: Turkish Morphological Patterns

### The Critical Test: Do Voynich words take Turkish suffixes?

Turkish suffixes:
- -lar/-ler (plural)
- -da/-de (locative: "in/at")
- -dan/-den (ablative: "from")
- -a/-e (dative: "to")
- -ı/-i/-u/-ü (accusative)
- -ın/-in/-un/-ün (genitive)

### Results for 'dal' (branch):

| Expected Turkish | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| dallar | branches | 0 |
| dalı | the branch | 0 |
| dalda | in the branch | 0 |
| daldan | from the branch | 0 |
| dala | to the branch | 1 |

**Actual Voynich 'dal-' forms:**

| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| dal | 243 | base |
| daly | 28 | dal + -y (Voynich suffix) |
| daldy | 17 | dal + -dy (Voynich suffix) |
| dalor | 8 | dal + -or (Voynich suffix) |
| dalol | 7 | dal + -ol (Voynich suffix) |
| dalam | 6 | dal + -am (Voynich suffix) |
| dalaiin | 3 | dal + -aiin (Voynich suffix) |
| dalar | 5 | **possibly** Turkish |

**Result: 'dal' takes VOYNICH suffixes, not Turkish suffixes.**

### Results for 'ol' (be/become):

Turkish verb conjugation:
| Form | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|------|---------|---------------|
| olur | he/she becomes | 0 |
| oldu | he/she became | 0 |
| olsun | let it be | 0 |
| olmak | to be | 0 |
| olmuş | has become | 0 |

**Actual Voynich 'ol-' forms:**

| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| ol | 525 | base |
| olaiin | 52 | ol + -aiin (Voynich case) |
| oly | 50 | ol + -y (Voynich suffix) |
| olchedy | 37 | ol + -chedy (Voynich) |
| olkeedy | 42 | ol + -keedy (Voynich) |
| olor | 31 | ol + -or (Voynich suffix) |

**Result: 'ol' takes VOYNICH suffixes, not Turkish verb conjugation.**

---

## Test 3: Vowel Harmony

Turkish has strict vowel harmony:
- Back vowels (a, ı, o, u) stay together
- Front vowels (e, i, ö, ü) stay together

Example: "dallar" (branches) not "daller"

### Voynich Vowel Patterns

Checking 'ol' derivatives:
- olaiin (a after o - OK for Turkish)
- olchedy (e after o - VIOLATES Turkish harmony)
- olkeedy (e after o - VIOLATES Turkish harmony)

Checking 'dal' derivatives:
- dalaiin (a after a - OK)
- dalchedy (e after a - VIOLATES)
- dalor (o after a - OK)

**Result: Voynich does NOT follow Turkish vowel harmony.**

## Test 4: Turkish Function Words

| Turkish | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| ve | and | 0 |
| bir | one/a | 0 |
| bu | this | 0 |
| şu | that | 0 |
| ile | with | 0 |
| için | for | 0 |
| var | there is | 0 |
| yok | there isn't | 0 |
| de/da | also | 0 (as particle) |
| ki | that (conj) | 0 |

**Result: NO Turkish function words found.**

---

## Test 5: Turkish Numbers

| Turkish | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| bir | one | 0 |
| iki | two | 0 |
| üç | three | 0 |
| dört | four | 0 |
| beş | five | 0 |
| on | ten | 0 |

**Result: NO Turkish numbers found.**

## Analysis: Why Vocabulary Matches But Grammar Doesn't

### The Pattern

1. **Vocabulary similarity**: 17+ words match Turkish
2. **Morphology mismatch**: Words take Voynich suffixes, not Turkish
3. **Function words absent**: No "ve", "bir", "bu"
4. **Vowel harmony absent**: Violates Turkish phonological rules

### Possible Explanations

1. **Coincidence**: Many CV and CVC combinations exist in multiple languages
   - "ol", "al", "dal" are simple syllables
   - Could match Turkish, Polish, or other languages by chance

2. **Common Turkic substrate**:
   - Voynich author had contact with Turkic peoples?
   - 15th century trade routes included Central Asia
   - But no grammatical influence shows

3. **Same root + different system**:
   - Borrowed Turkish vocabulary?
   - Applied Voynich grammar to Turkish words?
   - But no complete Turkish phrases exist

## Comparison: Turkish vs Other Languages

| Feature | Polish | Latin | Turkish | Voynich |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Vocabulary matches | 3-4 | 1-2 | **17+** | - |
| Grammatical patterns | NO | NO | NO | Own system |
| Function words | 0 | 0 | 0 | qo- only |
| Morphology type | Fusional | Fusional | Agglutinative | Agglutinative |

**Turkish has the MOST vocabulary matches but STILL fails grammatical tests.**

---

## Conclusion

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Vocabulary | **PARTIAL MATCH** (17+ words) |
| Morphology | **FAIL** (Voynich suffixes, not Turkish) |
| Vowel harmony | **FAIL** (Voynich violates it) |
| Function words | **FAIL** (none found) |
| Numbers | **FAIL** (none found) |

### Assessment

**Turkish is the BEST vocabulary match found so far**, but:
- The grammatical system is NOT Turkish
- Words take Voynich suffixes (-aiin, -dy, -ol) not Turkish suffixes (-lar, -dan, -da)
- Vowel harmony is violated
- No Turkish function words or numbers appear

### Hypothesis Status: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

The Voynich manuscript MAY contain:
- Turkic loanwords (dal, ol, al, etc.)
- Contact with Turkic-speaking peoples
- A pidgin or mixed language with Turkic elements

But it is NOT:
- Written in Turkish
- A cipher of Turkish
- Following Turkish grammar

---

## Implications

This is the strongest language connection found so far. Unlike Polish/Latin/Persian which showed NO vocabulary matches after testing, Turkish shows **17+ potential matches**.

However, the words follow **Voynich morphology**, not Turkish morphology. This suggests:

1. **Possible Turkic substrate** in a constructed/cipher language
2. **Trade language influence** from Central Asian contact
3. **Or coincidental similarity** of simple syllables

Further research needed:
- Test Old Turkic / Chagatai vocabulary
- Compare with other Turkic languages (Uzbek, Kazakh)
- Check historical context for Turkic contact in 15th century Europe
