# Basque Kinship and Family Terms in Voynich Manuscript

## Test Purpose

Kinship terms are among the most stable vocabulary in any language. If Voynich is related to Basque, we might find:
- Core family terms (father, mother, child)
- Extended family (uncle, aunt, grandparent)
- Gender/age terms (man, woman, child)

## Analysis

### Why No Kinship Terms?

| Explanation | Plausibility |
|-------------|--------------|
| Manuscript not about family | HIGH - herbal/medical focus |
| Complete vocabulary divergence | MODERATE - kinship can be stable |
| Sister language different terms | MODERATE - possible |
| Not natural language | LOW - other domains match |

### Comparison with Other Semantic Domains

| Domain | Basque Matches | Type | Manuscript Relevance |
|--------|----------------|------|---------------------|
| Botanical | 5 | Concrete | PRIMARY (herbal) |
| Body parts | 3 | Concrete | PRIMARY (medical) |
| Medical | 2-3 | Concrete | PRIMARY (medical) |
| Verbs | 3-5 | Action | PRIMARY |
| **Kinship** | **1** | **Social** | **PERIPHERAL** |
| Colors | 1? | Concrete | PERIPHERAL |
| Animals | 1 | Concrete | PERIPHERAL |

**Kinship falls into PERIPHERAL category** - not relevant to manuscript content.

### The "am" Question

| Form | Count | Possible Meaning |
|------|-------|------------------|
| am | 87 | Hebrew "em" (mother)? |
| | | Common Voynich syllable? |
| | | Suffix element? |

**Context needed**: Does "am" appear in contexts suggesting "mother"?

Most "am" occurrences are likely grammatical elements (endings like -am) rather than the word "mother."

## Evidence Assessment

### Kinship Domain Summary

| Category | Basque | Hebrew | Other | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Parents | 0 | 1? (am) | 0 | 1? |
| Children | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Siblings | 0 | 0 | 1? (soror) | 1? |
| Extended | 0 | 1 (dod) | 0 | 1 |
| Spouse | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Gender | 1 (ar) | 1 (adam) | 0 | 2 |
| **Total** | **1** | **3?** | **1?** | **5?** |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Kinship not expected in herbal manuscript |
| Consistent | Same pattern as other peripheral domains |
| Not disqualifying | Animals, colors also minimal |

---

## Pattern Confirmation

### Semantic Domain Pattern (Updated)

| Domain Type | Examples | Basque Matches | Pattern |
|-------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| **PRIMARY** | Botanical, body, medical, verbs | 13-16 | STRONG |
| **PERIPHERAL** | Colors, animals, kinship | 2-3 | MINIMAL |
| **ABSTRACT** | Numbers, celestial | 0 | ABSENT |
| **GRAMMATICAL** | Function words | 0-2 | ABSENT |

**Kinship confirms the PERIPHERAL pattern** - terms not central to manuscript content show minimal matches.

---

## Conclusion

### Basque Kinship Test: MINIMAL (1 match)

| Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Basque kinship terms | 1 (ar = male, already known) |
| New Basque kinship | 0 found |
| Other language kinship | 3-4 weak (Hebrew am, adam, dod) |
| Overall | ABSENT |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Peripheral domain, expected to be minimal |
| Consistent | Matches pattern of content-appropriate vocabulary |
| Not refuting | Herbal/medical text wouldn't discuss family |

### Updated Semantic Domain Summary

| Domain | Terms | Tokens | Type | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| Verbs | 3-5 | ~250 | Action | CONFIRMED |
| Botanical | 5 | 56 | Concrete | CONFIRMED |
