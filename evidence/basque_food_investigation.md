# Basque Food and Drink Terms in Voynich Manuscript

## Test Purpose

Food and drink terms could be relevant to a herbal/medical manuscript since:
- Many plants were used as food
- Recipes may include culinary ingredients
- Medical preparations often involve common foods

## Analysis

### Why No Food Terms?

| Explanation | Plausibility |
|-------------|--------------|
| Manuscript is medicinal, not culinary | HIGH |
| Plants shown as medicine, not food | HIGH |
| Sister language different food vocabulary | MODERATE |
| Recipe sections use different terms | POSSIBLE |

### Food in Medieval Herbals

Medieval herbals typically:
1. Focus on **medicinal properties**, not culinary uses
2. May mention preparation methods (boiling, etc.)
3. Often include **apothecary ingredients** rather than food

**The Voynich appears to follow this pattern** - plants for medicine, not cuisine.

### Comparison with Other Semantic Domains

| Domain | Basque Matches | Manuscript Relevance |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Botanical | 5 | PRIMARY (herbal) |
| Body parts | 3 | PRIMARY (medical) |
| Medical | 2-3 | PRIMARY (medical) |
| Verbs | 3-5 | PRIMARY (actions) |
| **Food/Drink** | **1** | **PERIPHERAL** |
| Colors | 1? | PERIPHERAL |
| Animals | 1 | PERIPHERAL |
| Kinship | 1 | PERIPHERAL |

**Food falls into PERIPHERAL category** - minimal matches expected.

## Evidence Assessment

### Food Domain Summary

| Category | Basque | Other Languages | Total |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Grains | 1 (olo) | 1 (ot) | 2 |
| Meats/Fish | 0 | 1? (dag) | 1? |
| Dairy | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Drinks | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Condiments | 0 | 1? (sal) | 1? |
| **Total NEW** | **0** | **2-3 weak** | **2-3** |

**Note**: "olo" (oat) already counted in botanical domain.

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Food not central to medicinal herbals |
| Consistent | Same pattern as other peripheral domains |
| Expected | Medieval herbals focus on medicine, not cuisine |

---

## Pattern Confirmation

### Semantic Domain Pattern (Updated)

| Domain Type | Examples | Basque Matches | Pattern |
|-------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| **PRIMARY** | Botanical, body, medical, verbs | 13-16 | STRONG |
| **PERIPHERAL** | Colors, animals, kinship, food | 3-4 | MINIMAL |
| **ABSTRACT** | Numbers, celestial | 0 | ABSENT |
| **GRAMMATICAL** | Function words | 0-2 | ABSENT |

**Food confirms the PERIPHERAL pattern** - terms not central to manuscript show minimal matches.

---

## Conclusion

### Basque Food Test: MINIMAL (1 match, already counted)

| Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Basque food/drink terms | 1 (olo=oat, already in botanical) |
| New Basque food terms | 0 found |
| Other language food | 2-3 weak (sal, dag, ot) |
| Overall | ABSENT |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Peripheral domain, expected to be minimal |
| Consistent | Matches pattern of content-appropriate vocabulary |
| Not refuting | Medicinal herbal wouldn't focus on food |

### Updated Semantic Domain Summary

| Domain | Terms | Tokens | Type | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| Verbs | 3-5 | ~250 | Action | CONFIRMED |
| Botanical | 5 | 56 | Concrete | CONFIRMED |

| Animals | 1 | 350 | Peripheral | MINIMAL |
| Kinship | 1 | 346 | Peripheral | MINIMAL |
| **Food/Drink** | **0 new** | **-** | **Peripheral** | **MINIMAL** |
| Function words | 0-2 | ~15 | Grammar | ABSENT |
| Numbers | 0 | 0 | Abstract | ABSENT |
| Celestial | 0 | 0 | Abstract | ABSENT |

**Total confirmed PRIMARY content matches: 14-16 terms, ~400+ tokens**
**Peripheral domains (colors, animals, kinship, food): 3-4 minimal matches**
