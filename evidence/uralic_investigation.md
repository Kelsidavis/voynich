# Investigation: Uralic Languages (Hungarian & Finnish) Connection to Voynich

## Background

Uralic languages are:
- **Agglutinative** (suffix-heavy) - matches Voynich structure
- **Not Indo-European** - distinct language family
- **Hungarian** was spoken in Central Europe in the 15th century (manuscript's era)

This makes Hungarian particularly relevant for testing.

## Test 5: Hungarian Word Morphology

### Does Hungarian 'dal' (song) take Hungarian or Voynich suffixes?

**Expected Hungarian forms:**
| Form | Meaning | Voynich Count |
|------|---------|---------------|
| dalok | songs (plural) | **0** |
| dalom | my song | **2** ✓ |
| dalod | your song | **0** |
| dala | his/her song | **1** ✓ |
| dalunk | our song | **0** |
| dalban | in the song | **0** |

**Actual Voynich 'dal-' forms:**
| Form | Count | Analysis |
|------|-------|----------|
| dal | 243 | base |
| daly | 28 | dal + -y (Voynich) |
| daldy | 17 | dal + -dy (Voynich) |
| dalor | 8 | dal + -or (Voynich) |
| dalol | 7 | dal + -ol (Voynich) |
| dalaiin | 3 | dal + -aiin (Voynich) |
| dalom | 2 | **possibly Hungarian** |
| dala | 1 | **possibly Hungarian** |

**Result: Mostly Voynich suffixes, with 2 possible Hungarian forms.**

## Test 6: Vowel Harmony

Both Hungarian and Finnish have vowel harmony:
- Hungarian: back (a,o,u) vs front (e,i,ö,ü)
- Finnish: similar system

### Voynich Vowel Patterns

Checking 'dal' derivatives:
- dalol (o after a - OK for Hungarian)
- dalchedy (e after a - VIOLATES)
- dalaiin (a after a - OK)

Checking 'kor' derivatives:
- koraiin (a after o - VIOLATES Hungarian)
- korchy (y after o - unclear)

**Result: Voynich does NOT consistently follow Hungarian vowel harmony.**

## Comparison: Hungarian vs Turkish vs Finnish

| Feature | Hungarian | Turkish | Finnish | Voynich |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Vocab matches | **12** | **17+** | 2 | - |
| Morphology type | Agglutinative | Agglutinative | Agglutinative | Agglutinative |
| Case suffixes | NOT found | NOT found | NOT found | Own system |
| Vowel harmony | Violated | Violated | N/A | No harmony |
| Function words | 0 | 0 | 0 | qo- only |

## Hungarian-Specific Analysis

### Historical Context

Hungarian was spoken in:
- Kingdom of Hungary (15th century Central Europe)
- Near where Voynich manuscript may have originated
- Contemporaneous with manuscript's carbon dating (1404-1438)

### Why Hungarian Matters

1. **Geographic proximity**: Hungary bordered regions where manuscript may have been created
2. **Trade connections**: Hungarian merchants traveled through Central Europe
3. **Unique vocabulary**: Some matches (dal, kor, kar) are distinctly Hungarian

### Unique Hungarian Matches (Not Shared with Turkish)

| Voynich | Hungarian | Turkish | Unique? |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| dal | song | branch | Different meanings |
| kor | age | ember | Different meanings |
| sor | row | - | Hungarian only |
| orom | peak | - | Hungarian only |
| alom | dream | - | Hungarian only |

| Possessive forms | **2-3 possible** (dalom, dala) |
| Case suffixes | **FAIL** (0 found) |

### Overall Assessment

**Hungarian: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED** (similar to Turkish)
- 12 vocabulary matches (3rd best after Turkish and Korean)
- Some unique words not found in other tested languages
- But grammar is NOT Hungarian

**Finnish: REJECTED**
- Only 2 vocabulary matches
- No grammatical evidence

### Ranking of All Languages Tested

| Rank | Language | Vocab Matches | Grammar Match |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Turkish** | 17+ | NO |
| 2 | Korean | 10 | NO |
| 3 | **Hungarian** | 12 | NO |
| 4 | Mongolian | 8 | NO |

## Hypothesis: Central Asian Trade Language?

The pattern emerging:
- **Turkish** (17+ matches) - Turkic trade language
- **Hungarian** (12 matches) - Central European
- **Mongolian** (8 matches) - Central Asian
- **Korean** (10 matches) - Altaic overlap

Could Voynich be a **trade pidgin** used along routes connecting:
- Central Europe (Hungary)
- Ottoman/Turkic lands
- Central Asia (Mongol territories)
- Far East connections

This would explain:
- Vocabulary from multiple language families
- Unique grammatical system (pidgin grammar)
- No complete paradigm from any single language
