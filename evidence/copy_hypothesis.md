# The Copy Hypothesis: Is Voynich a Copy of an Older Text?

## The Key Distinction

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Author** | The person who composed the original text |
| **Scribe/Copyist** | The person who copied it onto the surviving vellum |

**These may be different people, separated by decades or centuries.**

---

## Evidence Supporting the Copy Hypothesis

### 1. Vellum vs Text Dating

| What We Know | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| Vellum carbon-dated to 1404-1438 | The MATERIAL is early 15th century |
| Text could be older | Writing copied onto new vellum |
| No ink dating available | Cannot date the actual writing |

**The vellum dates the COPY, not the original composition.**

### 2. Linguistic Archaism

| Finding | If Original | If Copy |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Pre-IE vocabulary | Author spoke Pre-IE language | Original author spoke it; scribe may not have |
| No Latin influence | Author isolated from Latin | Original predates heavy Latin influence |
| Dying language features | Last speaker recording | Already dead language being preserved |

**A Pre-IE language with heavy borrowing fits better with an OLDER original:**
- 15th century: Pre-IE languages nearly extinct in Western Europe
- 13th-14th century: More plausible for living Pre-IE community
- 12th century or earlier: Even more plausible

### 3. Scribal Error Patterns

| Observation | Copy Indicator |
|-------------|----------------|
| Multiple transcription variants in EVA | Different scribes disagreed |
| Some words have unusual forms | Possible copying errors |
| Consistent misspellings? | Scribe unfamiliar with language |
| Abbreviations or unclear passages | Copying from damaged original |

### 4. Illustration Style vs Text

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Illustrations | May be redrawn/updated for copy |
| Plant drawings | Some appear stylized/simplified |
| Astronomical sections | May reflect older cosmology |
| Biological sections | Style consistent with 15th c. |

**Illustrations could be updated while text remains archaic.**

## Revised Timeline Hypothesis

### Scenario: Multi-Generation Transmission

```
ORIGINAL COMPOSITION
│
│  11th-13th century?
│  - Pre-IE speaking community still active
│  - Original author = native speaker/healer
│  - Text composed in living language
│
▼
FIRST COPY(?)
│
│  13th-14th century?
│  - Language declining
│  - Copied for preservation
│  - Some updating/additions?
│
▼
SURVIVING MANUSCRIPT
│
│  1404-1438 (vellum date)
│  - Final copy onto new vellum
│  - Scribe may not understand language
│  - Illustrations possibly redrawn
│
▼
PRESENT DAY
```

### What This Changes

| Aspect | If 15th c. Original | If Older Original + Copy |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Language age | Dying but living | Already dead |
| Author knowledge | Native speaker | Copyist may not understand |
| Borrowings | Recent contacts | Ancient contact patterns |
| Errors | Author mistakes | Copying mistakes |
| Purpose | Personal/community use | Preservation of ancient text |

## Evidence from the Manuscript Itself

### Signs of Copying

| Feature | Observation | Copy Indicator? |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Consistent hand | Single scribe for most | YES - professional copy |
| Some hand variations | Multiple scribes? | YES - copying project |
| Marginalia | Few additions | YES - sacred/fixed text |
| Corrections | Some visible | YES - copying errors fixed |
| Consistent format | Throughout manuscript | YES - following exemplar |

### Signs of Original Composition

| Feature | Observation | Original Indicator? |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Unique content | No known parallels | MAYBE - or lost tradition |
| Integrated text/image | Words fit illustrations | UNCLEAR - could be copied together |
| Consistent vocabulary | Same word patterns | EITHER - original consistency or faithful copy |

## Implications for Author Profile

### If Copy Hypothesis is Correct

**The ORIGINAL AUTHOR (11th-14th c.?):**
- Native speaker of Pre-IE language
- Professional healer/herbalist
- Language was still living (or recently dead)
- Composed text for practical use or teaching
- Community still existed

**The COPYIST (15th c.):**
- May or may not understand the language
- Copying for preservation
- Professional scribe skills
- Possibly commissioned by collector
- Working from damaged/old exemplar

### Revised Author Profile

| Trait | Original Author | 15th c. Copyist |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Language | Native Pre-IE speaker | May not understand |
| Date | 11th-14th century | 1404-1438 |
| Purpose | Practical use | Preservation |
| Knowledge | Expert healer | Professional scribe |
| Location | Pre-IE community | Northern Italy? |

## Why This Matters

### 1. Explains Linguistic Archaism

If the original is from the 12th-13th century:
- Pre-IE languages more plausible
- Explains lack of Latin (pre-scholastic period for some areas)
- Explains Turkic/Hungarian contact (Crusades, trade routes)
- Explains Semitic vocabulary (Mediterranean trade peak)

### 2. Explains Preservation Motive

Why copy an old herbal text in a dead language?
- Antiquarian interest
- Believed to contain valuable/secret knowledge
- Family/community heritage
- Collector's commission

### 3. Explains Scribal "Errors"

Features that seem inconsistent might be:
- Copying mistakes by unfamiliar scribe
- Damage to original (unreadable sections)
- Abbreviations not understood
- Dialect variations in original

### 4. Explains Illustration Updates

Illustrations could be:
- Redrawn for the copy (15th c. style)
- Updated/improved from worn original
- Added by copyist where original was damaged
- Based on copyist's interpretation

## Dating the Original

### Linguistic Evidence for Age

| Feature | Suggests Original Date |
|---------|------------------------|
| Pre-IE core vocabulary | Pre-1300? (before complete extinction) |
| Turkic contact words | 11th-14th c. (Crusades, Mongol period) |
| Hungarian words | Post-896 (Magyar settlement) |
| Semitic trade words | Any period (ancient trade routes) |
| No Latin influence | Pre-university spread or isolated community |

### Best Estimate for Original

| Scenario | Original Date | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Most likely** | 12th-13th century | Pre-IE plausible, trade contacts fit |
| Possible | 11th century | Early medieval, Pre-IE more common |
| Possible | 14th century | Late survival of Pre-IE community |
| Less likely | 15th century | Pre-IE very rare by then |

## The Transmission Chain

### Hypothetical History

**~1150-1250**: Original composition
- Pre-IE speaking healer in Pyrenean/Mediterranean region
- Creates herbal/medical compendium in native language
- Text used by community for generations

**~1250-1350**: First preservation efforts
- Language declining
- Text copied to preserve knowledge
- Possibly translated sections added?

**~1350-1400**: Text reaches collector/monastery
- Valued as ancient/mysterious text
- Stored with other manuscripts
- Original deteriorating

**~1404-1438**: Final copy made
- Professional scribe commissioned
- Copied onto new vellum (the surviving manuscript)
- Illustrations redrawn
- Scribe may not understand language

**~1450-1600**: Manuscript circulates
- Passes through various owners
- Rudolf II acquires it?
- Attempts at decipherment fail

## Revised Conclusions

### About the Original Author

> A healer or herbalist from a Pre-Indo-European speaking community, likely in the western Mediterranean or Pyrenean region, composing a medical/herbal compendium in their native language sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries. The author was a native speaker with practical expertise, creating a working document for professional or teaching use.

### About the Copyist

> A professional scribe working in northern Italy in the early 15th century, copying an older manuscript for preservation or a collector. The copyist may not have understood the language, faithfully reproducing letter forms without comprehension. The illustrations may have been redrawn or updated during this copying.

### About the Text

> The surviving Voynich manuscript is likely a 15th-century copy of a much older text, possibly dating to the 12th-13th centuries. The archaic language (Pre-IE, Basque-related) and the pattern of contact vocabulary (Turkic, Hungarian, Semitic) fit better with a medieval original than a 15th-century composition. The vellum dates the copy, not the original.

---

## Key Insight

**The Voynich manuscript may preserve a text 200-300 years older than the vellum it's written on.**

This would make it one of the last surviving records of a Pre-Indo-European language that was already dead or dying when the surviving copy was made.

The 15th-century scribe was not the author - they were a preservationist, possibly not understanding what they were copying, but faithfully transmitting an ancient text into the future.
