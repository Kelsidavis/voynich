# Basque Celestial Terms in Voynich Astronomical Sections

## Test Purpose

If Voynich is related to Basque, we might find Basque celestial terms in:
- Astronomical sections (f67-f73) with zodiac diagrams
- Star charts and celestial maps
- Any cosmological descriptions

## Astronomical Section Analysis

### Section Statistics (f67-f73)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total folios | ~7 |
| Content | Zodiac diagrams, star charts |
| Expected | Celestial vocabulary |

### Most Frequent Words in Astronomical Section

| Voynich | Count | Possible Meaning |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| ar | 57 | Basque "male"? |
| oteey | 44 | ? |
| al | 44 | Turkish "take"? |
| daiin | 43 | Common Voynich |
| dar | 39 | Already identified |
| aiin | 37 | Case marker |
| dal | 32 | Turkish "branch" |
| shey | 31 | Common Voynich |

**No celestial-specific vocabulary identified.**

### "sol" Distribution

| Section | "sol" occurrences |
|---------|-------------------|
| Astronomical (f67-f73) | 2 |
| Herbal (f1-f57) | ~30 |
| Biological (f75-f84) | ~20 |
| Recipe (f88-f116) | ~15 |

**"sol" is NOT concentrated in astronomical sections** - suggesting it may not mean "sun".

### "otar" Distribution

| Section | "otar" occurrences |
|---------|-------------------|
| Astronomical (f67-f73) | 17 |
| Herbal (f1-f57) | 53 |
| Biological (f75-f84) | 92 |

**"otar" is MOST frequent in biological section** - not celestial.

## Zodiac Sign Names

### Latin Zodiac Names

| Latin | Voynich | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Aries | 0 | ABSENT |
| Taurus | 0 | ABSENT |
| Gemini | 0 | ABSENT |
| Cancer | 0 | ABSENT |
| Leo | 0 | ABSENT |
| Virgo | 0 | ABSENT |
| Libra | 0 | ABSENT |
| Scorpio | 0 | ABSENT |
| Sagittarius | 0 | ABSENT |
| Capricornus | 0 | ABSENT |
| Aquarius | 0 | ABSENT |
| Pisces | 0 | ABSENT |

**ZERO zodiac names found from any language.**

---

## Analysis

### Critical Finding: Complete Absence of Celestial Vocabulary

| Category | Languages Tested | Matches |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Sun | 5 (Basque, Turkish, Hungarian, Latin, Mongolian) | 1? (sol - ambiguous) |
| Moon | 5 | 0 |
| Star | 5 | 0 |
| Sky | 5 | 0 |
| Zodiac | Latin | 0 |
| **Total** | | **~0** |

### Interpretation

The astronomical sections contain:
1. **Zodiac diagrams** - but no zodiac names
2. **Star-like symbols** - but no star vocabulary
3. **Circular/celestial layouts** - but generic vocabulary

**This is the second semantic domain (after numbers) with complete vocabulary absence.**

---

## Comparison with Other Semantic Domains

| Domain | Basque Matches | Other Language | Status |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Botanical | 5 | Some overlap | CONFIRMED |
| Body parts | 3 | Some overlap | CONFIRMED |
| Temporal | 1 | - | CONFIRMED |
| Colors | 1? | - | POSSIBLE |
| Numbers | 0 | 0 | ABSENT |
| **Celestial** | **0** | **1? (sol)** | **ABSENT** |

### Pattern Emerging

| Domain Type | Matches | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Concrete/tangible | SOME | Shared vocabulary |
| Abstract/systematic | NONE | Complete divergence |

Botanical terms, body parts, and colors are concrete/observable.
Numbers and celestial terms are systematic/abstract.

**The sister language may have diverged completely in abstract/systematic vocabulary.**

---

## Evidence Assessment

### For Pre-IE Remnant Hypothesis

| Finding | Weight | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| No Basque celestial | NEUTRAL | Sister language diverged |
| No ANY celestial | CONCERNING | Questions astronomical purpose |
| "sol" ambiguous | WEAK | Could be Latin sun OR Turkish left |

### What This Might Mean

1. **Different celestial vocabulary** in sister language
2. **Symbols instead of words** for celestial concepts
3. **Labels not translatable** - may be symbolic/encoded
4. **Not about astronomy** despite illustrations

---

## Conclusion

### Basque Celestial Test: NO MATCHES

| Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Basque celestial terms | 0 found |
| Other language celestial | 0-1 (sol - ambiguous) |
| Zodiac names | 0 found |
| Pattern | Same as numbers |

### Impact on Pre-IE Hypothesis

| Assessment | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **NEUTRAL** | Systematic vocabulary may diverge completely |
| Not refuting | Same pattern as numbers |
| Concerning | Two abstract domains now absent |

### Updated Semantic Domain Summary

| Domain | Basque | Status | Type |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Botanical | 5 | CONFIRMED | Concrete |
| Body parts | 3 | CONFIRMED | Concrete |
| Temporal | 1 | CONFIRMED | Semi-abstract |
| Colors | 1? | POSSIBLE | Concrete |
| Numbers | 0 | ABSENT | Abstract/systematic |
| **Celestial** | **0** | **ABSENT** | **Abstract/systematic** |

**Pattern**: Concrete vocabulary partially shared, abstract/systematic vocabulary completely absent.
