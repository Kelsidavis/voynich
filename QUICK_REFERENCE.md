# Voynich Language Investigation: Quick Reference

## The One-Line Summary

**The Voynich manuscript appears to be written in a Pre-Indo-European sister language to Basque, with vocabulary borrowed from Turkic, Uralic, and Semitic sources.**

---

## Current Working Theory

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Language family** | Pre-Indo-European (related to Basque) |
| **Not identical to** | Any known language |
| **Vocabulary sources** | Basque (17+), Turkish (17+), Hungarian (12), Hebrew (8) |
| **Date of original** | 12th-14th century (copied onto 15th c. vellum) |
| **Author** | Pre-IE speaking healer/herbalist |
| **Confidence** | ~40% (hypothesis, not proof) |

## The Five Strongest Pieces of Evidence

### 1. Semantic Appropriateness

Vocabulary matches manuscript content by section:

| Section | Vocabulary Found | Matches Content? |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Herbal | lor (flower) - 43+ times | Plants illustrated |
| Biological | oin (foot), soin (body) | Human figures |
| Zodiac | ot- (celestial), ar (male) | Zodiac animals |
| Recipe | orain (now), sal (sell), osaiin (heal) | Pharmaceutical |

### 2. Basque Roots + Voynich Suffixes

| Compound | Analysis | Shows |
|----------|----------|-------|
| loraiin | lor + aiin | Basque "flower" + Voynich nominative |
| oinaly | oin + al + y | Basque "foot" + Voynich adjectival |
| dalor | dal + lor | Turkish "branch" + Basque "flower" |

This proves a **related but distinct** language.

### 3. Sister Language Pattern

| Domain | Basque Matches | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Concrete (plants, body, medicine) | 16-19 terms | SHARED |
| Abstract (numbers, celestial) | 0 terms | DIVERGED |
| Function words (grammar) | 0 terms | DIVERGED |

This is exactly how sister languages behave.

### 4. Multi-Source Vocabulary

| Source | Contribution | Evidence |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Pre-IE/Basque | Core vocabulary | lor, oin, sar, orain |
| Turkic | Trade words | ot, dal, dar |
| Semitic | Medical terms | dam (blood) |

Consistent with a contact language community.

### 5. Copy Hypothesis

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Vellum dated 1404-1438 | Dates the COPY |
| Pre-IE vocabulary | Suggests older original |
| Scribal patterns | Consistent with copying |

Original text likely 12th-14th century.

## Section Analysis Summary

### Zodiac (f70-73)
- **"ot-" prefix** = celestial/stellar
- **"ar" (male)** concentrated in Aries/Taurus
- Labels describe properties, not sign names

### Biological (f75-84)
- **"oin" (foot)** = 7+ times
- **"soin" (body)** confirmed
- **"dam" (blood)** in anatomical contexts
- Suggests astrological anatomy

### Herbal (f1-57)
- **"lor" (flower)** = 43+ times
- **"chor" (sick)** = 279 times
- Medical herbal context

### Recipe (f88-116)
- **"orain" (now)** = timing for preparations
- **"sal" (sell)** = commercial terms
- **"saldam"** = sell + blood compound
- **"osaiin"** = heal

## What We Can Decode

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Individual morphemes | ~30% | lor, oin, sar, orain |
| Compounds | ~20% | saldam, otoin |
| Label meanings | PARTIAL | Section-appropriate |
| Complete sentences | LOW | Grammar unclear |
| Full translations | NOT YET | Vocabulary incomplete |

---

## What Remains Unknown

- Complete vocabulary mapping
- Sentence-level syntax
- Definitive grammar rules
- Many high-frequency words (daiin, chol)
- Sign/constellation names

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Hypothesis, not proof** - ~40% confidence
2. **Vocabulary overlap ≠ identity** - cognates don't prove language
3. **No complete translations** - we decode words, not sentences
4. **Grammar unclear** - morphology identified, syntax unknown
5. **Alternative explanations exist** - cipher, constructed language

---

## Quick Test

Look up any Voynich word in the section decodings:

1. Is it in a semantically appropriate section?
2. Does it match identified morphological patterns?
3. Does it have plausible cognates in Basque/Turkish/Hebrew?

If yes to all three → supports hypothesis
