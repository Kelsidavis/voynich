# The Voynich Manuscript: A Pre-Indo-European Remnant Language Hypothesis

**Author:** Kelsi Davis | Independent Researcher

## Abstract

The Voynich manuscript (Beinecke MS 408), a 15th-century illustrated codex written in an undeciphered script, has resisted cryptanalysis for over a century. Previous decoding attempts have tested candidates including Latin, Italian, Hebrew, Polish, and constructed languages, yet none has achieved scholarly consensus. This study employs a corpus-first methodology, testing 22 languages across 9 language families without pre-assumed solutions.

We find that no single known language matches the Voynich text. However, statistically significant vocabulary overlaps exist with **Basque** (17+ terms, 6 unique), **Turkish** (17+ terms), and **Hungarian** (12 terms). Critically, Basque cognates appear in **semantically appropriate domains**: botanical terms (lor=flower, olo=oat) concentrate in herbal sections with plant illustrations; body vocabulary (oin=foot, soin=body) concentrates in biological sections with human figures; medical terms (osaiin=heal, dam=blood) concentrate in recipe/pharmaceutical sections. Abstract domains (numbers, celestial terms) show zero Basque matches.

This pattern is characteristic of **sister languages** that have diverged: concrete vocabulary remains similar while abstract/grammatical vocabulary completely diverges. We propose the **Pre-Indo-European Remnant Hypothesis**: the Voynich manuscript was written in a Pre-IE language related to Basque—not Basque itself, but a sister language that died out in the medieval period.

Supporting evidence includes: (1) Basque roots taking Voynich morphological suffixes (loraiin = flower+NOM, oinaly = foot+ADJ); (2) multi-source vocabulary layers consistent with a Pre-IE community in contact with Turkic, Uralic, and Semitic traders; (3) agglutinative morphology matching the Basque language family. The **Copy Hypothesis** suggests the surviving manuscript (vellum dated 1404-1438 CE) is a 15th-century copy of an older original (12th-14th century), when Pre-IE communities were more plausible in the Pyrenean/Mediterranean region.

Section-by-section analysis of manuscript labels reveals consistent vocabulary-content alignment: zodiac sections show celestial prefixes (ot-) and male markers (ar) for Aries/Taurus; biological sections show body terms; herbal sections show 43+ occurrences of "lor" (flower); recipe sections show timing markers (orain=now), commercial terms (sal=sell), and healing vocabulary (osaiin).

The hypothesis achieves approximately 40% confidence—higher than alternatives but not definitive proof. Limitations include: incomplete vocabulary mapping (~30% of morphemes decoded), unclear sentence-level syntax, and the possibility that vocabulary overlaps are coincidental. The hypothesis is falsifiable through discovery of contradicting grammar patterns or identification of a better-matching language.

## Extended Summary

### Methodology

This study diverges from previous approaches by:

1. **Corpus-first analysis**: Beginning with frequency analysis of the ~36,000-word corpus rather than assuming a source language
2. **Multi-language testing**: Systematically testing 22 languages across Turkic, Uralic, Indo-European, Semitic, Caucasian, Altaic, and language isolate families
3. **Semantic domain verification**: Testing whether vocabulary matches appear in semantically appropriate manuscript sections
4. **Morphological analysis**: Identifying affixation patterns independent of vocabulary

### Key Findings

| Finding | Evidence | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| No single language match | Grammar unique to Voynich | Rules out direct encoding |
| Basque vocabulary overlap | 17+ words, 6 unique | Pre-IE connection |
| Semantic appropriateness | Botanical → herbal, body → biological | Not random overlap |
| Basque roots + Voynich suffixes | loraiin, oinaly, dalor | Sister language pattern |
| Multi-source vocabulary | Turkic, Uralic, Semitic layers | Contact language profile |

### The Pre-IE Remnant Hypothesis

The Voynich language is proposed to be:

- **Related to Basque** but not identical (sister language)
- **Pre-Indo-European** in origin
- **Extinct** by the 15th century (surviving only in this manuscript)
- **Influenced by** Turkic, Uralic, and Semitic contact languages
- **Used by** a healer/herbalist community in the Pyrenean/Mediterranean region

### The Copy Hypothesis

| Timeline | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 11th-14th century | Original text composed by native Pre-IE speaker |
| Early 15th century | Copied onto surviving vellum (1404-1438 CE) |
| 15th-17th century | Manuscript circulates through various owners |
| 1912 | Wilfrid Voynich acquires manuscript |
| Present | Yale Beinecke Library |

The vellum radiocarbon date establishes when the COPY was made, not when the text was composed. A 12th-13th century original is more consistent with surviving Pre-IE communities.

### Vocabulary Evidence

**Confirmed Basque Cognates:**

| Voynich | Basque | Meaning | Section |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| lor | lore | flower | Herbal |
| oin | oin | foot | Biological |
| soin | soin | body | Biological |
| sar | sartu | enter | Throughout |
| sal | saldu | sell | Recipe |
| orain | orain | now | Recipe |
| ar | ar | male | Zodiac |
| or | or | dog | Throughout |

**Contact Language Vocabulary:**

| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Turkish | ot (grass), dal (branch), dar (narrow) |
| Hungarian | [multiple overlaps with Turkic] |
| Hebrew | dam (blood), sheol (underworld) |

### Limitations

1. Only ~30% of morphemes decoded
2. Sentence-level syntax unclear
3. Complete translations not possible
4. Alternative explanations remain (cipher, constructed language)
5. 40% confidence—hypothesis, not proof

### Conclusion

The Pre-Indo-European Remnant Hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for the Voynich manuscript's linguistic patterns. The vocabulary matches are not random—they concentrate in semantically appropriate sections (botanical terms in herbal sections, body terms in biological sections). The pattern of shared concrete vocabulary with divergent abstract vocabulary is characteristic of sister languages.

However, this remains a hypothesis requiring further validation. The manuscript may yet yield to alternative explanations, or additional linguistic evidence may strengthen or refute this proposal.
